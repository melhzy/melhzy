ABSTRACT
Older adults suffer from a high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), in which urinalysis may 
appear positive (presence of bacteria, white blood cells, and nitrates), often triggering initiation of 
antibiotics in acute care settings, without actual urinary tract infection (UTI) present. To investi -
gate the urinary microbiome of older adults being tested for UTI, we enrolled a convenience 
sample of 250 older adult Emergency Department patients who had microscopic urinalysis 
ordered as part of their routine clinical care. Urinalysis results were classified as positive or 
negative, and patients were classified as being symptomatic or asymptomatic based on estab -
lished diagnostic guidelines. We sought to determine if features of the urinary microbiome 
differed between positive and negative urinalysis (UAs) and symptomatic and asymptomatic 
patients with positive UAs. The same urine sample used for clinical testing was sequenced and 
analyzed for bacterial taxa, metabolic pathways, and known bacterial virulence factors. After 
exclusion of anatomical abnormalities and filtering for sequencing quality, 152 samples were 
analyzed (5 negative UAs, 147 positive UAs, among which 68 were asymptomatic, and 79 
symptomatic). Positive UA samples showed significantly lower alpha diversity (2.29 versus 0.086, 
p < 0.01) and distinct community composition based on beta-diversity (PERMANOVA on Bray- 
Curtis distance p < 0.01). Alpha and beta diversity did not significantly differ between asympto -
matic and symptomatic patients. Machine learning classifiers combining clinical covariates other 
than specific signs and symptoms and microbiome features (taxa, metabolic pathways, or viru -
lence factors) revealed mostly microbiome features as predictive of symptomatic UTI over clinical 
features.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
It was once thought that human urinary tracts were 
normally sterile environments, but it is now known that 
there is a community of microorganisms that resides in 
the urinary tract, known as the urinary microbiome or 
uromicrobiome [1–8]. Changes in the urinary micro -
biome have been connected to a wide variety of geni -
tourinary conditions such as urinary urge incontinence, 
pelvic pain syndromes, and recurrent urinary tract 
infections (UTIs) [9,10]. Annually in the US, UTI is 
listed as the cause of some 1 million Emergency 
Department (ED) visits and 15% of acute care hospita -
lizations among patients 65 years of age and older [11]. 
UTI is a potentially life-threatening diagnosis as it can 
progress to sepsis and septic shock, which carries high 
mortality [12]. Despite its prevalence and impact on the 
healthcare system, appropriate diagnosis of UTIs remains a challenge, especially in older adults. This is 
because a substantial portion of the population over age 
65 have a condition known as asymptomatic bacteriuria 
(ASB) in which the urinary tract is colonized with 
potentially pathogenic bacteria, but the individual 
does not have symptoms and does not benefit from 
treatment with antibiotics [13]. ASB is defined by the 
Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) as a urine 
culture growing 105 colony forming units of a known 
urinary pathogen from an individual who is having no 
symptoms [14]. Since urine cultures can take up to 3  
days, what is typically relied upon as a proxy in the ED 
are the results of microscopic urinalysis (UA) that are 
suggestive of infection, i.e. the presence of nitrites, the 
presence of leukocyte esterase greater then trace, or 
greater than 10 white blood cells per high-powered 
field on microscopy [15]. The IDSA only recommends

treating these patients with antibiotics only if they have 
signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as 
dysuria, lower abdominal or perineal pain in the case of 
uncomplicated infection, or flank pain and fever in the 
case of complicated infection, coincident with UA find-
ings that are suggestive of infection [14]. Guidance 
from the IDSA suggests that, except for pregnant 
women or those undergoing invasive urologic proce -
dures, there is no benefit to treating ASB with antibio -
tics [16]. ASB prevalence is 10–20% in community- 
dwelling older adults [17] and as high as 50% in those 
who reside in skilled nursing facilities [13]. Among 
patients with positive urine cultures admitted to an 
inpatient service from the ED about 25% did not have 
signs or symptoms of UTI [18]. These discrepancies 
highlight the difficulties in accurately distinguishing 
ASB from UTI, especially in the acute care setting.
The clinical tests most frequently used to diagnose 
UTI, the UA and urine culture, have significant limita -
tions. A study of adult ED patients suggested that a UA 
with features previously mentioned as associated with 
UTI had a specificity of 54% and a positive predictive 
value of 38% for a positive urine culture [15]. Because 
the UA alone lacks specificity for diagnosis of UTI, 
published guidelines suggest that UA should only be 
used in patients with signs and symptoms of UTI 
[19,20]. Despite this, clinicians frequently test for and 
initiate treatment for presumed UTI in the absence of 
signs or symptoms of infection [21]. A study of patients 
admitted from the ED to a general medical service 
found that as many as 80% of older patients had 
a UA ordered without the presence of urinary symp -
toms [22]. This discrepancy between actual practice 
and recommended guidelines may in part reflect the 
poor specificity of current standard diagnostic proce -
dures as well as the desire of physicians to be thorough 
when presented with cases with multiple possible dif-
ferential diagnoses, as is often the case in the ED 
setting.
The urinary microbiome may hold insights in dis-
tinguishing between ASB and UTI. There may be char -
acteristics of the overall community that are suggestive 
of one state versus the other. An imbalance of patho -
gens over other commensal species in urine may be the 
microbiologic signature of shifting from ASB to UTI. 
Metagenomic data about the presence of specific viru-
lence factor genes or metabolic pathways could provide 
additional clues. For example, Uropathogenic 
Escherichia coli (UPEC) typically require pathogenicity 
factors, often encoded on pathogenicity islands [23] to 
cause active disease; colonizing organisms in patients 
with ASB may lack genes for pathogenicity factors and 
thus, the presence or increased abundance of specific genes may be a reliable signature of UTI. There are also 
likely metabolic requirements for organisms to estab -
lish infection in the urinary tract that could signal 
a transition to UTI. Given that the urinary microbiome 
field is relatively new and comprehensive characteriza -
tion is emerging, more studies, especially in clinical 
populations, are warranted.
The primary objective of this study was to examine 
the urinary microbiome of older adult patients with 
suspected UTI on initial evaluation in the ED. Using 
metagenomic sequencing and machine learning-based 
multimodal analysis we sought to determine if urinary 
microbiome features showed reliable differences 
between symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients, 
with the goal of selecting highly discriminatory features 
that could potentially be investigated as diagnostic 
targets.
Materials and methods
Patient recruitment
We enrolled in a convenience sample of adult patients 
over 65 years old admitted to the UMass Memorial 
University Campus ED from January 2022 through 
April 2023 who had a urinalysis ordered and collected 
as part of routine clinical care. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients. If a patient was 
deemed not to have capacity by medical providers or 
documented in their chart, written informed consent 
was obtained from patient’s legally authorized repre -
sentative (next of kin or designated health care proxy). 
Those with potentially confounding anatomic abnorm -
alities (e.g. urostomy or nephrostomy) and chronic 
indwelling Foley catheters on ED admission were 
excluded as these conditions may cause unknown long- 
term changes to the urinary microbiome not reflective 
of ASB. Patients who had a urinary catheter placed at 
the ED visit in which they were enrolled were not 
excluded, as this is frequently performed to obtain 
specimens from individuals who are incontinent of 
urine or otherwise cannot provide a sample on demand 
and represents an important population to study with 
respect to UTI. Patients were interviewed for current 
urinary symptoms including new onset dysuria (pain 
on urination), urinary frequency, urinary urgency, 
urinary incontinence, hematuria, urinary retention, 
lower abdominal pain, fever, or flank pain. Signs of 
urinary tract infection including lower abdominal ten-
derness, altered mental status, and costovertebral angle 
tenderness were obtained from electronic medical 
records. Patients were also asked about recent medical 
history including hospitalizations, surgeries, urinary2

catheterization, recent antibiotic treatment, and recent 
urinary tract infections. Past medical history, current 
medications, ED disposition, final diagnosis were all 
obtained via chart review. A complete list of patient 
variables that were collected and used as covariates 
within the models is shown in Table S3. We also review 
study participants’ medical charts up to 14 days post 
admission to determine if there were any additional 
unplanned hospitalizations, treatments for urinary 
tract infection, or death.
Urine samples were obtained by nursing staff in the 
ED either by mid-stream clean catch or urinary cathe -
ters in patients incontinent of urine or otherwise not 
able to provide a sample. Although as previously stated, 
anyone with a chronic indwelling urinary catheter on 
admission was excluded. Patients were categorized as 
having symptoms of UTI based on current diagnostic 
guidelines of signs and symptoms provided by IDSA 
and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
[13,19,20]. That is, the presence of dysuria considered 
most specific for UTI, or the presence of at least two 
signs or symptoms that could be attributed to UTI 
based on patient interview and physician chart review. 
These included fever, altered mental status, generalized 
weakness, lower abdominal pain, urinary frequency, 
urinary urgency, new urinary incontinence, new urin -
ary retention, flank pain, or flank tenderness. 
Traditional urinalysis results were considered positive 
if there was at least one feature consistent with infec -
tion that is usually used by emergency physicians to 
make treatment decisions regarding UTI; these were 
the presence of nitrites, the presence of leukocyte ester -
ase greater then trace, or greater than 10 white blood 
cells per high-powered field on microscopy [15]. The 
human subjects research protocol used for this study 
was approved by the UMass Chan Institutional Review 
Board (Docket # H00014312)
Sample collection and processing
The remainder of the urine samples from enrolled 
patients provided to the clinical laboratory for tradi -
tional microscopic urinalysis and urine culture were 
kept at 4°C in the UMass Memorial Renal Laboratory 
until they were collected by study staff and then stored 
long term at −80°C. Samples were thawed and batch 
processed for sequencing in sets of 20 samples at 
a time. A total volume of 5 mL of each urine sample 
was used for metagenomic analysis. Left-over samples 
of less than 5 mL of urine were diluted with DNA/RNA 
shield solution (Zymo Research) to 5 mL each. 
Eukaryotic cell contaminants were first removed by 
low-speed spin at 180 g ×15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were then pelleted for bacteria by spinning at 3000 rcf 
×15 min and washed once with 5 mL of DNA/RNA 
shield solution. The final pellet was resuspended in 
250 µL of DNA/RNA shield and total DNA extracted 
using the Zymo Research DNA miniprep kit with bead- 
beating step. Samples were prepared for paired-end 
sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA library prepara -
tion kit (Illumina) and sequencing was performed on 
the Illumina NextSeq at the UMass Chan Center for 
Microbiome Research. Negative controls were not 
included in library preparation and sequencing and 
corrections for batch sequencing were not performed.
Sequence processing and analysis
Shotgun metagenomic reads were first trimmed and 
quality filtered to remove sequencing adapters and 
host contamination using Trimmomatic [24] and 
Bowtie2 [25], respectively, as part of the KneadData 
pipeline version 0.10.0 (https://huttenhower.sph.har 
vard.edu/kneaddata/ ). Recognizing that urine samples 
have lower biomass, we have taken steps to ensure 
results would not be affected by random contamination 
by rejecting samples below a threshold of a certain 
number of metagenomics reads (500,000, see below). 
This helps ensure removal of samples representing low 
abundance laboratory contaminants and robust 
sequence counts for downstream analysis to reduce 
batch-to-batch variation.
Relative abundances of different microbial taxa were 
calculated using Metaphlan3 [26]. Relative abundances 
of detected microbial metabolic pathways were deter -
mined using HUMAnN3 [27] and measured as Read 
Per Kilobase Million (RPKM) (number of aligned 
reads/kilobase gene size * 1000000) to account for vary -
ing sizes of alignment targets. Relative abundances of 
virulence factors were measured by aligning KneadData 
processed reads against protein sequence databases of 
known bacterial virulence factors (http://www.mgc.ac. 
cn/VFs/ ) [28]. Sequences were aligned using the 
DIAMOND aligner [29] in blastx mode with default 
settings for sensitivity of alignment ( > 60% identity). 
Abundance of virulence factor genes was also measured 
in RPKM.
Data analysis
Analyses were performed in R and Python. Shannon 
diversity indices, PERMANOVAs on Bray-Curtis dis-
tances, and tests of homogeneity of betadispersion were 
calculated using the vegan package [30]. Non-metric 
MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination plots 
were generated using the R phyloseq package [31].VIRULENCE

================================================================================

Differential abundance of taxonomies across variables 
of interest were measured with Maaslin2 [32], using the 
compound-Poisson linear model method due to the 
zero-inflated nature of urinary microbiomes and 
default settings for statistical significance and the 
Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple compari -
sons. Basic cleaning of collected clinical data was per-
formed in python JupyterNotebook with the pandas 
and numpy packages. Specifically, unstructured clinical 
data was filtered for relevant clinical data of interest 
(e.g. diagnoses and chart notes directly associated with 
UTI) and objective variables were converted to binary 
for machine learning analyses. Urinary symptoms were 
left out of machine learning models as these were used 
to distinguish between asymptomatic patients with 
positive UA (suggestive of ASB) and symptomatic 
patients (suggestive of UTI) in our study; thus, inclu -
sion would have introduced obvious bias into the mod -
els. Graphs were generated using the R ggplot2 package 
[33]. Final figures were arranged using Adobe 
Illustrator and BioRender.
Machine learning based classifier analysis
We examined seven approaches for handling high- 
dimensional tabular datasets that have previously been 
applied to microbiome data, as well as a neural network- 
based algorithm, which can show superior performance 
with large datasets [34]: Elastic Net Regression [35], Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression [36], Ridge Regression [37], Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) regression [38], a Random Forrest 
Classifier [39] (RFC), TabNet [40], and XGBoost [41]. 
All approaches were implemented to predict symptomatic 
versus asymptomatic cases (“0” represents asymptomatic 
cases, and “1” represents symptomatic cases), utilizing 
features derived from clinical covariates which included 
the results of clinical testing, including the results of 
microscopic UA as well as pertinent past medical history 
listed in Table 1. This data was then combined with the 
results of microbiome analysis which included measure -
ments of taxonomies, metabolic pathways, and known 
virulence factors represented in the sequencing data. 
This resulted in three datasets taxonomies + clinical cov-
ariates (761 features), metabolic pathways + clinical cov-
ariates (456 features), and virulence factors + clinical 
covariates (2171 features).
For in-depth explanations of the machine-learning 
based methods used in this analysis, please see our 
materials supplement. We examined model perfor -
mances by F1 score, Area Under the Receiver- 
Operator Curve (AUC), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, 
and Specificity. The F1-score is a harmonic mean 
between precision and recall. This accounts for both 
prediction errors and the specific type of prediction 
error. We highlight the F1-score as our main model 
evaluation metric because the F1-score accounts for 
imbalanced data and extremes in either recall or preci -
sion while maximizing both. Thus, this metric is well 
suited for cases where both false positives and false

negatives are undesirable. AUC provides a balanced 
measure between the true positive rate and false posi-
tive rate, describing how well a model distinguishes 
between positive and negative classes. Recall is the 
rate of true positive prediction. Precision is how often 
a true positive result is predicted. Specificity is how 
often a true negative result is predicted. Accuracy mea-
sures the proportion of both true positives and true 
negatives among the total number of cases, assessing 
the model’s overall correctness. F1 score identifies posi-
tive cases while equally penalizing false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN), thereby balancing concern for 
both precision and recall. A summary of these metrics 
for each of the different models is shown in Table S2.
Results
The overall study schema is shown in Figure 1. Of 250 
enrolled patients, 10 were excluded due to anatomic 
abnormality (suprapubic catheter, urostomy, etc.). An 
additional 93 were excluded for insufficient metage -
nomic reads. Although this represents a large portion

of the cohort, this exclusion ensured that low abun -
dance contaminants that could be introduced by hand -
ling and batch effects from different sequencing runs 
did not overly impact downstream analysis. Of the 
remaining cohort, 147 returned positive UAs with or 
without urinary symptoms while 5 had negative UAs, 
all without symptoms.
When examining negative UA vs positive UA micro -
biomes, negative UA communities showed higher rich-
ness (number of species in each microbiome) (48.4 mean 
species negative UA versus 19.7 positive UA, p = 0.01 for 
ANOVA on richness), and evenness (similar abundance 
across all species detected) (mean Pielou’s evenness 0.59 
negative UA and 0.3 positive UA, p = 0.018 for ANOVA 
on evenness). Alpha diversity, a combined metric 
reflecting richness and evenness within individual sam-
ples, as measured by Shannon index (Figure 2(A) ), was 
significantly higher in negative UA microbiomes (med -
ian Shannon index 2.286 for negative UA versus 0.08633 
in positive UA samples, p = 0.002 Mann-Whitney 
U-test). Examining beta diversity, a metric of how 
much microbiome compositions differ between groups, 
we found significant centroid distances in Non-metric 
MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination plots 
(Figure 2(B) ) between positive UA and negative UA 
groups (PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis distance p =  
0.0033), variances were not significantly different 
(ANOVA on beta-dispersion p = 0.778). Utilizing the 
Microbiome Multivariable Association with Linear 
Models (Maaslin2) package [32], we found that that 
positive UA samples contained more Escherichia (p =  
1.9 ×10−6). Other organisms detected in much smaller 
amounts included Campylobacter ureolyticus (p = 5.3 
×10−5), Peptoniphilus duerdenii (p = 0.015), and 
Propionibacterium lymphophilum (p = 0.04) were higher 
in the negative UA samples (Figure 2(C) ).
We next examined positive UA samples as sympto -
matic versus asymptomatic cases on the basis of signs 
and symptoms of UTI (68 categorized as asymptomatic, 
79 as symptomatic). The baseline characteristics of 
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were very 
well balanced with respect to demographics, recent 
antibiotic treatment, hospitalizations, primary resi-
dence, baseline incontinence of stool or urine, and 
dementia diagnoses (Table 1). The only medical history 
that varied between groups was a history of Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (p = 0.009, 
chi-square). The association between UTI and COPD 
among older adults has been reported in the past [42]. 
Individuals with COPD are thought to be at increased 
risk of UTI due to treatment with anti-cholinergic 
medications used to manage COPD causing urinary 
retention [43]. We also examined if any features of the microscopic UA typically used to diagnose infection 
(white blood cells/hpf, red blood cells/hpf, presence of 
nitrites, qualitative presence of bacteria) varied across 
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. There were no 
significant differences in any of these metrics when 
examined across symptomatic vs asymptomatic cases 
(Supplemental Figure 1).
We next examined broad metrics of microbiome 
composition across these groups. Alpha diversity did 
not differ significantly between asymptomatic and 
symptomatic cases (median Shannon index in 0.0819 
versus 0.116, p = 0.543 Mann-Whitney U-test) 
(Figure 2(D) ). No significant difference in the centroid 
distances between asymptomatic and symptomatic 
cases was seen (PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis dis-
tance p = 0.736) (Figure 2(E) ). We also explored Bray- 
Curtis distance between microbiomes associated with 
clinical covariates of interest, including urinary cathe -
terization within the prior three months, sex, living in 
the community versus residing within a nursing home 
or assisted living apartment, hospitalization or surgery 
within the last three months, presence of dementia, 
incontinence of stool or urine, and antibiotic treat -
ment for any indication within the last three months, 
the complete results of which are listed in Table S1. 
Beta-diversity did not differ when examining micro -
biomes from male and female participants, which was 
also true in our previous study of the urinary micro -
biome of nursing home residents [44], and may reflect 
age-related changes in the microbiome that are shared 
among men and women. When comparing partici -
pants with and without a diagnosis of dementia, 
there were significant differences in beta diversity 
(PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis p = 0.015, n = 123 
without dementia, n = 24 with some dementia diagno -
sis), although the beta dispersion did vary significantly 
between these groups as well (ANOVA on beta- 
dispersion p = 0.0016) which could be somewhat 
responsible for this finding (Table S1). The NMDS 
ordination plot of Bray-Curtis distances between 
these two groups is shown in Figure 3(A) . We also 
explored which taxa were associated with dementia 
diagnosis using Maaslin2. Six species associated with 
a diagnosis of dementia. E. coli was returned as having 
a positive association with the diagnosis of dementia 
(p = 0.003) while five other taxa present at lower rela-
tive abundance showed a negative association with 
dementia. Mean relative abundances of these taxa 
across the two groups and significance of the associa -
tion are shown in Figure 3(B) .

with antibiotics directed against UTI. These results are 
shown in Table 2. Patients with a diagnosis of dementia 
were older (p = 0.047, Mann-Whitney U test), but no 
other clinical covariate we hypothesized could contri -
bute to urinary microbiome dysbiosis varied signifi -
cantly differently across the groups, although there 
was a trend towards additional antibiotic treatment 
for UTI in the past (Chi-squared p = 0.096).
An advantage of metagenomic sequencing is being 
able to analyze microbiome features beyond taxonomy. 
Thus, we generated datasets of relative abundance of 
genes within known metabolic pathways [27] and rela-
tive abundance of known virulence factors by counting reads aligned against the VFDB database of protein 
sequences associated with known virulence factors 
[28]. We trained machine-learning based classifier 
models on three multimodal datasets: available clinical 
data (without specific signs and symptoms of UTI used 
to classify cases) combined with either relative abun -
dance of taxa, RPKM of metabolic pathways, or RPKM 
of known virulence factors. The neural network-based 
TabNet showed the most consistent results across all 
performance metrics and datasets. Some penalized 
regression models such as LASSO and ridge regression 
showed higher mean F1 scores, but at the cost of 
specificity (Table S2). Most of the models we tested 
return ranked importance of which features of the

some organisms was higher in the negative UA samples. (D) Shannon alpha diversity index did not vary across asymptomatic vs

modeled datasets contributed most to the classification 
outputs (symptomatic versus asymptomatic). In most 
models, microbiome features (taxa abundance, meta -
bolic pathways, or virulence factors) were ranked as 
more important than non-symptom clinical inputs. 
We selected TabNet as our final model due to its con-
sistent performance across all datasets in this study. 
Compared to other classifiers, TabNet achieved the 
most balanced trade-off between sensitivity (recall) 
and specificity. Figures 4–6 (top panels) show the 
ranked importance from the TabNet models.
Examining the important features in the TabNet 
model built on relative abundance of different taxa, 
the relative abundance of a species of an unclassified 
Bacteroidaceae (mean relative abundance 0% in asymp -
tomatic versus 0.035% in symptomatic), was the most 
important feature, followed by the abundance of 
Ruminococcaceae bacterium , with higher relative abun -
dance in our symptomatic group (mean relative abun -
dance 0.00012% asymptomatic versus 0.0013% in 
symptomatic). The abundance of Blautia massilensis 
(mean relative abundance 0.085% versus 0.025%) and 
a Parasutterlla (mean relative abundance 0.016% versus 
0.00012%) taxa were the next two most important 
features and showed higher abundance in urinary 
microbiomes from individuals classified as asympto -
matic (Figure 4). In the model built on metabolic path -
way abundance, summarized in Figure 5, the two most 
important features were the abundance of the Pentose- 
phosphate pathway (mean RPKM 2730 in symptomatic 
versus 2567 in asymptomatic), and a clinical covariate, 
the level of serum creatinine, both higher in sympto -
matic patients (Figure 5). The pathways for homolac -
tate fermentation, and menaquinone biosynthesis were 
also higher in microbiomes of symptomatic patients 
(mean RPKM 1647.5 versus 1131.5 and mean RPKM 
1210.5 versus 1131.5 respectively). Pathways for fatty 
acid beta-oxidation, nicotinamide (NAD) salvage, and glycogen degradation were more abundant in asympto -
matic cases (mean RPKM 25.3 versus 12.3, 103 vs 80, 
and 812.5 vs 687.5 respectively). Another clinical cov-
ariate, a positive urine culture for Klebsiella was slightly 
higher in asymptomatic cases. In the model built on 
relative abundance of virulence factors, summarized in 
Figure 6, the most important features were a type II 
secretion protein (genbank ID WP_016352169) (mean 
RPKM 58.1 in symptomatic versus 71.8 in asympto -
matic), a component of flagellum assembly (genbank 
ID WP_015444575) (mean RPKM 38.9 versus 40.3) and 
a type IV secretion system effector protein (Genbank 
ID WP_010948683) (mean RPKM 1.5 vs 0.83).
Discussion
There appears to be a clear distinction in our cohort 
between the urinary microbiome from patients with 
a positive microscopic UA and those whose UA do 
not show any findings consistent with infection (nega -
tive UA). These include much higher alpha diversity, 
higher richness, and evenness for negative UA and clear 
differences in beta diversity between negative and posi-
tive UA. This finding is consistent with studies of the 
microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract [45], which 
show that in general, a more diverse microbiome is 
reflective of a healthy microbiome; in this way a UA 
with findings consistent with infection and lower in 
microbial compositional diversity could be considered 
a dysbiotic or unhealthy state. The presence of diverse 
commensal organisms could potentially be harnessed as 
testing for a “healthy” urinary microbiome and could 
be targeted in future studies to determine if they per-
form some active function in preventing pathogen 
colonization. Alternatively, the presence of inflamma -
tion within the urinary tract could also drive dysbiosis. 
Previous work has shown that in both ASB and UTI, 
there are higher abundances of proteins associated withTable 2. Examination of clinical factors across patients with and without dementia.

neutrophil activation, degranulation, and chemotaxis in 
the urine of individuals with evidence of infection [46].
Of particular interest is the overwhelming presence of 
E. coli in those with positive UA, suggesting this organism 
is much more common in subjects with a positive UA, 
whether they have symptoms or not. C. ureolyticus , 
P. duredeni , and P. lymphophilum were more abundant 
in negative UA microbiomes. These organisms have been 
variously reported to be potential human pathogens [47– 
49], but their presence here in the urine of patients with 
negative UAs indicates they may be beneficial commensal 
organisms. Alternatively, they may become pathogenic in 
the setting of dysbiosis or specific perturbation of com -
mensal community structure. Thus, normal colonization of specific bacteria within a healthy urinary microbiome 
may exist along a continuum wherein dysbiosis of specific 
species may precede ASB and UTI and symptoms present 
in context with immune activation and an altered 
uromicrobiome.
An unexpected result was a difference in beta-diversity 
of the urinary microbiome between patients with demen -
tia versus those without. Although beta-dispersion did 
vary between these groups, PERMANOVA is considered 
to be a test that is least likely to be affected by hetero -
geneity in beta-dispersion between groups [50]. When 
examining what features were associated with 
a dementia diagnosis using Maaslin2, the potential patho -
gen, E. coli, was detected more frequently and in higher

abundance in those with a dementia diagnosis, while 
higher abundances of Prevotella timonensis, 
Porphyromonas bennonis, Bacteriodes uniformis, 
Peptoniphilus coxii , and an uncharacterized taxa were 
negatively associated with dementia. While some of 
these organisms may be opportunistic pathogens [51– 
53], their presence at relatively low abundance suggests 
they are likely commensals in this context, and overgrowth of E. coli may represent dysbiosis among 
individuals with dementia. We did explore non- 
symptom clinical factors among patients with dementia 
that could potentially explain the observed dysbiosis such 
as recent antibiotic treatment, hospitalization, urinary 
catheterization, or residing in the community versus 
a nursing home. Although patients with dementia were

Mann-Whitney U test), no other clinical covariate was 
significantly associated with dementia (Table 2). How 
dementia may be driving this dysbiosis or vice versa 
could be investigated in the future.
On initial examination, the most striking feature of 
our cohort of subjects with positive UAs is the very 
high number of asymptomatic cases (68 cases or 46%). 
These patients should not have had urinalysis obtained 
at all if clinical guidelines were strictly adhered to. The 
microbial community of individuals with a positive UA was remarkably similar whether they had signs and 
symptoms of UTI or not. No diversity metrics showed 
significant differences. We have used machine learning- 
based classifiers to explore multimodal microbiome 
data to find meaningful microbiome features associated 
with clinical conditions or outcomes in the past and 
applied it to this dataset [54,55]. We employed a wide 
array of popular machine learning-based classifier algo-
rithms, of these, the neural-network based TabNet 
model performed most consistently across metrics.

TabNet’s architecture supports instance-specific feature 
selection through its sequential attention mechanism. 
Unlike Lasso, Ridge, or SVM, which use a fixed set of 
features across all samples, TabNet adjusts the rele-
vance of features for each case. This flexibility is parti -
cularly important in microbiome-based classification, 
where patient-specific microbial signatures often vary 
substantially. As shown in Table S2, TabNet has the 
most consistent performance metrics with superior spe-
cificity, consistent recall, sample-level feature selection, 
and low variance across seeds.
Although we hypothesized that microbiome fea-
tures would reliably distinguish symptomatic versus 
asymptomatic patients and that these features could 
subsequently be examined for use as enhanced diag -
nostics for true UTI, we acknowledge that the per-
formance of these models is not reliable enough to be 
used in clinical testing to discriminate between 
potential ASB and UTI. The high number of asymp -
tomatic cases and the modest performance of our in- 
depth microbiome analysis highlight that antibiotic 
stewardship campaigns that focus on education and 
adherence to guidelines remain the most likely inter -
ventions to reduce inappropriate testing and antibio -
tic treatment. However, the high importance of 
microbiome features in our models provides biologi -
cal insight into the importance of the urinary micro -
biome in these two states, and we believe some broad 
themes emerge.
In our model built on taxonomies, we observed that 
the most important feature was the relative abundance of 
an uncharacterized Bacteroidaceae strain, which was 
more abundant in microbiomes classified as sympto -
matic. This family is typically anaerobic and associated 
with the gut microbiome. Its presence here may indicate 
ascending colonization of microbiota from the gut which 
is suggested to be the source of some uropathogens [56]. 
Another taxa that showed higher abundance in sympto -
matic microbiomes was a strain of Ruminococcaceae , 
which is a potential pathobiont that has been associated 
with the urinary microbiome of individuals with bladder 
cancer [57] and was positively correlated with lower 
urinary tract symptoms in men [58]. Another taxa with 
higher abundance in microbiomes classified as asympto -
matic include a Parasutterella species, a taxa that is more 
typically observed in the gut microbiome [59], but inter -
estingly, is depleted in individuals who suffer from 
recurrent UTIs [56], suggesting it maybe a protective 
commensal. B. massilensis was also more abundant 
among asymptomatic patients, members of this family 
and genus have been negatively associated with urinary 
symptoms in men [58], suggesting it may be another 
protective commensal.When examining the model built on relative abun -
dance of microbial metabolic pathways and non- 
symptom clinical features, important features may be 
suggestive of a role for specific patho-adaptations in 
eliciting symptoms. Features more abundant in micro -
biomes from symptomatic patients included the pen-
tose phosphate pathway, homolactate fermentation, 
and menaquinol biosynthesis. Considering these in 
the context of infection, the pentose phosphate pathway 
in E. coli is involved in generating reducing potential 
and building blocks for biomolecules [60] and is upre -
gulated in E. coli in the setting of UTI [61]. Oxygen 
tension in urine can be quite low and it is likely that 
anaerobic fermentation (such as homolactate) pathways 
are important virulence factors for UPEC [62]. 
Menaquinone is specifically involved in anaerobic 
metabolism and UPEC mutants in this pathway show 
decreased fitness in models of urinary tract infection 
[63]. Important microbial pathways with higher abun -
dance in microbiomes classified as asymptomatic 
included fatty acid beta oxidation, NAD salvage path -
way, and glycogen degradation. Fatty acid biosynthesis, 
as opposed to degradation, has been observed to be 
upregulated in E. coli isolated from human UTI speci -
mens [64]. E. coli seems to rely on nucleotide salvage 
for planktonic growth in urine, but requires de novo 
synthesis during invasive infection [60]. Glycogen 
metabolism was seen to be important in a mouse 
model of E. coli intestinal colonization [65], but utiliza -
tion of other carbon sources seems to be more impor -
tant in causing UTI [66]. Overall, pathways associated 
with colonization show higher abundance in micro -
biomes classified as asymptomatic, whereas those that 
seem to be important in rapid growth are more abun -
dant in symptomatic UTI microbiomes. Indeed, the 
ability to grow rapidly in the relatively anaerobic host 
environment may be the decisive factor in causing 
infection [67] as opposed to simply colonizing the 
urinary tract. Of note, two clinical variables appeared 
among the top ten features in this model, including 
a higher serum creatinine in symptomatic individuals, 
which may reflect decreased kidney function in indivi -
duals suffering from UTI, and the percentage of 
patients with positive urine cultures for Klebsiella , sug-
gesting that this organism may more commonly be 
associated with asymptomatic colonization.
When examining the model built on relative abun -
dance of virulence factors and clinical features, two 
important themes were secretion systems and bacterial 
flagellum components. Genes associated with flagellum 
assembly (flgJ and flgC) were more abundant in asymp -
tomatic microbiomes. The flagellum is a structure 
involved in bacterial motility, and in a mouse modelVIRULENCE

of cystitis, this was seen to be important in persistence 
in the bladder [68]. Type II and Type IV secretion 
systems are ubiquitous among Gram negative patho -
gens and may have a role in the pathogenesis of UPEC 
[69]. Interestingly, the type II secretion system compo -
nent gspF was more abundant in asymptomatic micro -
biomes where as a Type IV secretion effector was more 
abundant in symptomatic microbiomes (mean RPKM 
1.5) versus asymptomatic (mean RPKM 0.84). These 
systems are pathogenicity factors for a wide range of 
Gram-negative pathogens [70], but their role in UTI 
has not been established.
It is important to note that the classifiers used here 
return feature importance in predicting outcomes as 
defined by our clinical and laboratory criteria. 
However, they do not inherently return the direction 
of the association (e.g. whether a higher or lower 
abundance, presence or absence of a feature is predic -
tive) or a traditional statistical confidence or p-value 
associated with feature importance. Neural networks 
can consider features in combination; so the abun -
dance in each individual sample may only be predic -
tive as part of a combination of other feature patterns 
considered in the model. In our discussion, we have 
simplified the analysis of predictive features by exam -
ining their abundance in one state versus another to 
attempt to make inferences regarding biologic pro-
cesses which may underly the development of sympto -
matic UTI. These features should be considered 
together as part of a pattern distinguishing micro -
biomes from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients 
and we have tried to highlight unifying themes within 
results.
Strengths and weaknesses
This was a well-balanced cohort that incorporated clin-
ical covariates and microbiome features into our ana-
lysis and showed significant differences between 
balanced groups (symptomatic versus asymptomatic, 
dementia versus no dementia). Strengths also included 
microbiome measurements taken from point-of-care 
samples, inclusion of laboratory testing, and detailed 
surveys of current signs and symptoms for as accurate 
of a distinction between UTI and ASB diagnosis as 
possible on the basis of all available data in the acute 
care setting. We also were able to include patients who 
lacked capacity to consent, a group for which clinicians 
face difficulty in obtaining history of UTI symptoms 
and represent a greater diagnostic challenge. Although 
our final F1 scores from machine learning models were 
modest, all models trended towards positive ( > 0.5) 
predictions.A weakness of this study includes its relatively small 
final cohort (68 asymptomatic patients, 79 with symptoms, 
and 5 patients with negative UA). As such, results of our 
analysis of negative UAs may not be widely generalizable as 
this is based on the small sample size of five individuals. 
Many patients/samples had to be discarded because of very 
low metagenomic content, which was necessary to ensure 
robust microbiome data for analysis. In microbiome ana-
lysis of low biomass sites like urine and airway, it is possible 
that contamination by handling or introduced by lab 
equipment can bias results [71]. Although we did not per-
form negative control sequencing samples, we did not 
detect as significant any taxa commonly associated with 
skin or environmental microbiome. Also, issues with con-
tamination can be avoided with higher biomass inputs, 
which we effectively instituted by using a minimum meta -
genomic sequencing cut off [72]. Analyzing samples with 
minimum metagenomic content also helps prevent bias 
from different sequencing batches [73].
Another limitation was the use of convenience sam-
ples, which had to be evaluated and ready for research 
staff to obtain during regular business hours. It is 
possible that some unmeasured bias for certain patient 
types could be introduced by this practice and the 
results may not be generalizable across patients pre-
senting at any time. Nonetheless, our measured demo -
graphic factors were well balanced across asymptomatic 
and symptomatic patients. Another weakness and 
potential explanation for our modest F1 scores may 
be that the patients who may have only had nonspecific 
symptoms, such as fever and altered mental status, may 
have had an alternative final diagnosis that was not 
captured by our 14-day chart review. It is also possible 
that individuals with dementia would be considered 
asymptomatic more frequently as they may have lim-
ited ability to report symptoms such as dysuria. 
However, our cohorts were balanced with respect to 
dementia diagnosis, so we do not believe that there was 
a bias towards classifying these patients as asympto -
matic. Non-specific signs and symptoms like fever or 
altered mental status in the setting of a positive UA 
would usually be considered diagnostic and 84% of 
such cases in our cohort were indeed treated with 
antibiotics directed against UTI specifically. The IDSA 
guidelines do recommend that additional testing be 
performed for alternative explanations in such cases 
before initiating treatment for UTI [13], but our data 
does not capture what, if any, the results of those 
additional tests might be. If an alternative explanation 
was responsible for a patient’s symptoms, some cases 
could be later classified more accurately as asympto -
matic for machine learning model training. Despite 
these challenges, we were able to describe significant14

================================================================================

community level differences between microbiomes pre-
sent in positive versus negative UAs, as well as unex -
pected community differences in patients with and 
without dementia. Our machine-learning based analysis 
did identify microbiome features primarily as predic -
tive of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases, sug-
gesting that there are features within uromicrobiome 
that are associated with symptoms in UTI.
Conclusions
This metagenomic analysis of older adult ED patients with 
suspected UTI highlights the continued difficulties of diag-
nosing and treating older adult patients for UTI, especially 
in the acute care setting. Nearly half of our participants 
with a positive UA did not have signs and symptoms that 
would qualify for testing for UTI based on IDSA and 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines 
(and thus should not have been tested in the first place). 
While this can be regarded as a failure of strict guideline 
adherence on the one hand, on the other hand, the results 
of these asymptomatic UAs may give us insight about 
a previously underappreciated biologic process: the transi -
tion from a healthy to a dysbiotic uromicroboime and 
further, the transition from ASB to true clinical infection. 
Indeed, clear definitions between these transition points 
and states are still undefined. Machine learning-based 
methods are becoming more prevalent in the analyses of 
complex microbiome data, and we have attempted to apply 
it here to divulge insight into what distinguishes ASB from 
UTI from a clinical perspective based on acute care setting 
information. Our analyses suggest some functional uromi -
crobiome characteristics (genes favoring colonization 
activities versus virulence activities) may aid in distinguish -
ing these two states and may offer clues into the biologic 
mechanisms that result in physiologic symptoms of UTI.
