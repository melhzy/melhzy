Populus simoniiABSTRACT
Understanding the mechanisms by which genes control and regulate complex quantitative traits during periods 
of fluctuating resources remains a challenging and uncertain task in photosynthesis studies. Most studies have 
focused on the structure of photosynthesis, the photosynthetic response under stress, or the genetic mechanisms 
involved in photosynthetic effects and neglected the interactive genetic mechanism that governs various traits 
through significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
In this study, we have developed a differential dynamic system that enables the identification of QTLs based on 
the photosynthetic phenotypic and genotypic data under varying levels of light intensity gradients. The frame -
work not only allows for the assessment of the direct effects of QTLs on phenotypes but also captures how they 
influence interactions among phenotypes as light intensities change. We have analyzed the genetic effects and 
genetic variance, visualized the genetic network associated with photosynthesis interactions, and validated the 
effectiveness and stability of the DDS framework. Pivotal pleiotropic QTLs were identified individually to un-
cover the process and pattern of interaction. Through functional annotation, we made an intriguing discovery 
that seemingly unimportant QTLs can still have significant genetic effects on phenotypic changes through their 
regulation with other QTLs. This finding emphasizes the significance of considering the interactive genetic ar-
chitecture when seeking to understand the genetic interaction mechanism of photosynthesis in natural pop-
ulations of woody plants. Moreover, our research provides a novel framework that can be extended to explore the 
interactive genetic architecture among organisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of stress resistance 
mechanisms in woody plants.
1.Introduction
The genetic capabilities of plants enable them to adapt to various 
environmental conditions, including salt stress, drought stress, light 
stress, and more. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the 
genetic mechanisms operating under variable environments is crucial 
for advancing the research and cultivation of woody plants. Enhancing 
the efficiency of photosynthesis stands at the forefront of forest genetics 
and breeding as a key area of focus. Despite substantial efforts to explore photosynthesis, most studies focus on evaluating the overall changes of 
individual traits, rather than revealing the interactions among different 
traits (Evans, 2013 ; Petroutsos et al., 2016 ; Sharwood et al., 2016 ; van 
Rooijen et al., 2017 ; Bailey-Serres et al., 2019 ; Yoo et al., 2019 ; Heyduk 
et al., 2019 ; Nam et al., 2021 ; Baikie et al., 2023 ). The chlorophyll 
fluorescence parameters are of great significance, including maximal 
Fluorescence (Fm), Electron Transfer Rate (ETR), Quantum Photo -
chemical Yield (Yield), Photochemical Quenching Coefficient (qP), and 
Non-Photochemical Quenching coefficient (qN). Many explorations

2primarily focus on plant photosynthetic characteristics, adversity stress, 
seed selection, breeding, and other related areas (Zhang et al., 2020 ; 
Zhao et al., 2017 ; Herlory et al., 2013 ; Jian et al., 2020 ; de Oliveira 
Santos et al., 2021 ; Perner, F. et al., 2023 ). However, gaining a 
comprehensive understanding of how chlorophyll fluorescence param -
eters interact to control photosynthesis is a timely and vital undertaking. 
This endeavor significantly contributes to improving our knowledge of 
the genetic processes involved in photosynthesis. Furthermore, con-
structing an interaction genetic network of chlorophyll fluorescence 
parameters holds great value as it allows for the exploration of the un-
derlying genetic mechanisms of photosynthesis from multiple perspec -
tives (Flood et al., 2011 ). Photosynthesis in nature involves complex 
chemical reactions and physiological processes. Currently, a wide range 
of classical methods is available for analyzing unknown genetic mech -
anisms, including interval mapping based on linkage analysis, 
whole-genome association analysis (GWAS), and more (Lander and 
Botstein, 1989 ; Zeng, 1994 ; Risch et al., 1996 ; Zhu, 1999 ; Barton and 
Keightley, 2002 ; Klein et al., 2005 ; Wu et al., 2007 ; Li et al., 2008 ; 
Mackay, 2014 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ; Fang et al., 2017 ; Farooq et al., 2018 ; 
Sun et al., 2018 ; Tang et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Hazzouri et al., 2019 ; 
Fernandes et al., 2020 ; Cai et al., 2021 ; Zhang, J. et al., 2021 ; Zhang, Y. 
et al., 2021 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Scholz et al., 2022 ; Sun et al., 2022 ; de 
Klein et al., 2023 ; Khunsriraksakul et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ).
The methods mentioned above mainly focus on a single phenotype; 
however, it is vital to acknowledge the interactions among multiple 
phenotypes that aim to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and minimize 
light loss within the process of photosynthesis. These interactions form 
complex networks between phenotypes and genotypes (Stachowicz, 
2001 ; Agrawal, 2001 ; Bieluszewski et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). In 
addition, functional mapping, through the integration of mathematical 
functions, can effectively capture the developmental features of complex 
traits (Jiang et al., 2018 ; Fu et al., 2018 ; Dong et al., 2023 ). In recent 
years, there has been a growing promotion of functional mapping to-
wards system mapping. This approach allows for the exploration of two 
or more phenotypes by treating the entire set of phenotypes as a system. 
By employing a group of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the 
interaction patterns can be detected. Notable studies that have 
employed this approach include those conducted by Ma et al., (2002) , 
Wu and Lin (2006) , Wu et al. (2011) , Bo et al. (2014) , Sun and Wu 
(2015) and Zhou et al. (2023) .
In this paper, we focus on studying the chlorophyll fluorescence 
parameters in a natural population of Populus simonii under different 
gradient light intensities. Given the complexity and diversity of natural 
populations, our proposal involves the utilization of a differential dy-
namic system (DDS) to delve into the genetic mechanism of dynamic 
interactions during the process of photosynthesis. DDS not only employs 
differential equations to model the interaction between two phenotypes 
but also integrates optimized system mapping to capture the dynamic 
changes of phenotypes across multiple stages, identifying the genetic 
loci most likely to influence these changes. To validate the practical 
application of the DDS framework, we selected highly related pheno -
types, ETR and qN (Fig. S1). We then describe and explain how pivotal 
pleiotropic QTLs influence the trends of photosynthesis-related pheno -
types and construct their networks to elucidate the genetic mechanisms 
underlying their internal interactions. In total, 250 and 78 pivotal 
pleiotropic QTLs were identified, governing both competition and 
collaboration within the process of photosynthesis. The accuracy of our 
model is confirmed through rigorous validation using computer simu-
lations. Our research presents a robust tool for the selection of varieties 
and the exploration of genetic mechanisms in diverse environmental 
conditions.2.Materials & methods
2.1. Plants, growth conditions, and sampling
We applied a set of experimental data from Populus simonii to validate 
the utility of the DDS model. Native individual branches of Populus 
simonii were collected from various regions throughout the species ’ 
natural distribution range, including 9 provinces and 17 cities in 
northern China. All samples were planted in a randomized complete 
block design with several clonal replicates, spaced at 3 m ×4 m in 
Guanxian, Liaocheng, Shandong Province (36•29′89″N, 115•27′34″E). 
These samples were stored in low-temperature stratified sand in a clonal 
arboretum for cutting propagation in the next year. In the second year, 
cuttings were propagated and 102 samples (three seedlings with optimal 
growth for each sample) with similar annual growth trends were 
selected and transplanted into flowerpots. They were then cultured in a 
greenhouse at Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China (40•0′N, 
116•20′E). Phenotypic measurements were performed using a chloro -
phyll fluorescence meter (pam-2100) one week after planting. For each 
sample, the 3rd to 5th mature leaves from top to bottom were selected 
for measurement. During the measurement process, 11 segments of 
excitation light with gradually increasing intensities were selected to 
irradiate the leaves. The 11 light intensities are: 7.3887, 47.1704, 
82.6482, 133.0713, 214.3032, 347.6767, 498.9641, 769.0832, 
1144.9921, 1722.707, 2677.758 μmol≡m 2≡s 1. The chlorophyll 
fluorescence phenotypes were measured after each excitation light 
irradiation. Each leaf was measured three times, and the average value 
was recorded. During the experiment, the temperature was steadily kept 
at 24 •C, with a standard deviation of 1 •C. During measurements, the 
humidity was maintained between 20% and 40%.
2.2. Genomic DNA extraction and sequencing
Fresh leaves from 120 individuals in the association population were 
collected for genomic DNA extraction. The genomic DNA was re- 
sequenced using an Illumina GA2 platform, achieving an average 
sequencing depth of 30 ×. Library preparation was performed in 
accordance with the manufacturer ’s guidelines (Illumina). Paired-end 
reads of 150 bp were generated, with low-quality reads (those with 
≽50% nucleotides having a quality score DQ20) being removed prior to 
further analysis.
2.3. Data processing and SNP calling
The genomic DNA of the sampled populations was extracted using an 
improved Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) method. Filtered 
reads were aligned to the P. simonii reference genome using SOAPaligner 
(SOAP2, v2.20) with default parameters. Only uniquely mapped reads 
were retained for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling to 
ensure the identification of high-confidence variants. SNP identification 
was then performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit 4.0 (GATK4). For 
downstream analysis, SNPs within the association population were 
filtered using VCFtools, excluding insertions and deletions (InDels). 
SNPs with more than 20% missing data and those with minor allele 
frequencies (MAFs) less than 0.05 were discarded. Finally, we obtained a 
total of 4,996,309 SNPs distributed across the 19 chromosomes.
2.4. GWAS analysis
GWAS is a technical method used to establish associations between 
phenotypes and genotypes. This technique primarily focuses on 
analyzing static cross-sectional data and identifies significant SNPs that 
regulate or influence phenotypes at a specific time. Considering the di-
versity of natural populations, classical GWAS models can be classified 
into four categories: (1) Generalized Linear Model (GLM), which does 
not consider group structure or kinship; (2) Kinship Model (KM), which K. Lu et al.

3incorporates kinship information; (3) Group Structure Model, which 
takes into account group structure; and (4) Group Structure and Kinship 
Model (QKM), which considers both population structure and kinship 
factors. These models can be described using equation (9):

where Gi represents the genotype at marker i; β is the fixed genotype 
effect at marker i; Xi is the 1×p row vector of the population structure at 
marker i representing the population structure; η is the fixed population 
structure effect at marker i (which is a p×1 column vector); bi denotes 
kinship random effect at marker i.
We adopted a mixed linear model (MLM) that considers kinship and 
population structure (equation (9)(d)), and implemented it in Efficient 
Mixed Association eXpedited (EMMAX, version-beta). This model 
accounted for both population structure (Q matrix) and pairwise kinship 
(K matrix), which were calculated within the EMMAX framework. Sta-
tistical significance was determined by calculating p-values for each 
SNP-trait association, using a significance threshold of p ≼1E-05, where 
p 1/n and n represents the number of independent markers.
2.5. Differential dynamic system framework
We propose a differential dynamic system (DDS) that incorporates 
the independent growth features of ETR and qN using the LV equation. 
Denoting X as ETR and Y as qN at the light intensity of l, our DDS model 
is expressed as

representing the dependent growths of ETR and qN that arise from the 
interaction of the target trait with its co-existing trait through an 
inherent mechanism. In the DDS model, aX and aY denote the inde-
pendent growth rates of ETR and qN respectively, KX and KY are the 
maximum growth values of ETR and qN respectively, and bY represents 
the rate at which qN grows to the maximum value. The dependent 
growth is determined by the phenotype of the interacting trait that co-
exists with the target trait. The degree of this dependence is described by 
interaction parameters rY→X and rX→Y, and interaction scale parameters θY→X and θX→Y.
Complex quantitative traits exhibit intricate interactions and form 
dynamic systems that regulate physiological processes in the natural 
world. The DDS framework provides a method to elucidate the patterns 
of biomass growth and the interactions among its components. We 
employ model (2) to investigate the genetic mechanism underlying ETR 
and qN in the natural population of Populus simonii . Let the number of 
samples be n, all samples are genotyped for genome-wide single nucle -
otide polymorphism, and phenotypic typing is carried out based on a

We establish the initial parameters based on the biological signifi -
cance of each parameter and the mean curve of the sample data. Sub-
sequently, we utilize the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve 
the DDS model. During the numeric experiment, the BFGS algorithm is 
introduced to guarantee the precision and reliability of DDS model 
under the maximum error 10 5.
2.6. Identification of significant QTLs
The presence of significant pleiotropic QTLs associated with the 
interaction between ETR and qN can be detected using log-likelihood 
ratio (LR) statistics. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for 
the DDS model can be expressed as follows:

The LR statistics can be expressed as

(11) 
where the likelihood values L0 and L1 are calculated based on H0 and H1 
respectively, and LR statistics are compared with the critical threshold 
determined from the Bonferroni correction. Note that the null hypoth -
esis states that these DDS parameters are genotype invariant.
We can also test whether a significant QTL affects the independent 
part by formulating the following equation:

The LR statistics for the above two pairs of hypotheses are compared 
with the corresponding critical thresholds to identify important QTLs 
that influence the dependent growth and interact growth, respectively. 
The QTL that is significant in hypothesis test (10) is referred to as the 
"pivotal pleiotropic QTL" due to its significant contribution to the gen-
eral growth between ETR and qN.
2.7. Construction about the network of QTLs
In the photosynthesis system, each SNP controls the traits not only 
through its own genetic effects, but also activates or inhibits by other 
SNPs (Gu et al., 2016 ). We tried to construct the dynamic genetic reg-
ulatory network of ETR and qN under different light intensities based on 
quasi-dynamic ordinary differential equations (qdODEs) (Gu et al., 
2016 ; Anderson et al., 2021 ; White, 1924 ; Volterra, 1928 ; Krumbeck 
et al., 2021 ; Paczkowski et al., 2021 ; Stone, 2016 ; Jolma et al., 2013 ; 
Wang et al., 2021 ; Wu and Jiang, 2021 ). Each node in a network has 
limited links, reconstructing a sparse network based on qdODEs is 
equivalent to identifying and choosing a small number of variables that 
affect a focal variable. Multiple regression model can specific the focal 
variable (response) as a combination of all other variables (predictors) 
across samples. The Legendre Orthogonal Polynomial (LOP)-based 
approach can be used to smooth the data, and the LASSO method is used 
for variable selection before the qdODEs formed.

zations of networks are implemented through ‘Cytoscape ’ software.2.8. Computer simulation
The simulation experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, we 
assumed the presence of two photosynthetic traits, namely, trait 1 and 
trait 2, which interacted developmentally through cooperation and/or 
competition. The parameters  
aXjCaYjCbYjCKXjCKYjCrY→XjCrX→YjCθY→XjC
θX→Yj)
and the SAD(1) parameters for covariance structure of chosen 
significant QTL (i.e. pivotal pleiotropic QTL) were used as original 
values for phenotypic data simulation. We simulated a family of size n 
30, 50, 100, respectively. Heritability was the proportion of genetic 
variance in the simulated phenotypic variance, and two levels of H2 
were utilized: H2 0.05 and 0.1. The size of heritability was used to 
adjust the magnitude of innovative variance. We then conducted two 
separate simulations with 1000 markers each: one simulation included a 
significant QTL, while the other did not. For the former, we recorded 
whether the DDS framework could successfully identify the significant 
QTL from the 1000 genetic markers. This simulation was repeated 100 
times, and the proportion of simulations in which the significant QTL 
was successfully identified out of the 100 trials was defined as the QTL 
mapping accuracy. For the latter, the proportion of simulations in which 
a QTL was incorrectly identified out of the 100 trials was defined as the 
false positive probability. In the second part, we selected a significant 
pleiotropic QTL, simulated the genotype-specific growth curve of this 
QTL under heritability (n 0.05, 0.1, 0.2), and compared its consistency 
with the real growth curve.
3.Results
3.1. Technology roadmap
Phenotype and genotype data were collected following an experi -
mental routine (Fig. 1a). The influence of the population structure 
vector and kinship matrix on ETR and qN was assessed using the bio-
logical software Admixture and EMmax, respectively (Fig. 1b). Addi-
tionally, the DDS model was utilized to capture the overall, independent, 
and interactive growth trends of ETR and qN (Fig. 1c). LR statistics were 
used to distinguish significant pleiotropic QTLs, with a threshold 
determined by the Bonferroni method (Fig. 1d). We visualize the QTL- 
QTL network of pivotal pleiotropic QTLs and implement functional 
annotations to interpret the gene mechanism (Fig. 1e). Pivotal pleio-
tropic QTLs can be classified into different modes based on their dy-
namic gene effects (Fig. 1f). Computer simulations are designed to 
demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the DDS model (Fig. 1g).
3.2. Variability of selected traits
ETR and qN serve as indicators of the photosynthetic efficiency and 
stress resistance of plants during the photosynthetic process (Zhang 
et al., 2020 ). The coefficient of variation (CV) decreased sharply from 
56.9% (l12B00) to 19.3% (l23B85), and gradually declined further 
to 16.0% for ETR (Fig. 2a and b). The value started to gradually increase 
once the light intensity exceeded l6 (5.85), and eventually reached a 
steady rise to 25.0% (l117B89). It is worth noting that the CV of ETR 
did not exhibit a consistent decreasing trend. Instead, there was a small 
amplitude oscillation observed, ranging from 15.1% (l34.41) to 
17.3% (l76.21). This observation suggests that trees possess the 
ability to self-regulate during the photosynthetic process. Additionally, 
significant outliers in phenotype values were noticed under the initial 
light intensity (Fig. 2c), indicating a potential association with the rapid 
transition of plants from a dark environment to a light environment. As 
the light intensity gradually increased, the number of outliers decreased 
progressively. The outliers eventually disappeared after reaching l9 
(7.04), suggesting that the impact of light intensity on ETR weakened 
with stronger light intensities. The CV of qN was considerably higher 
during the initial stage (Fig. 2b), exceeding that of ETR by more than K. Lu et al.

5two-fold. This indicates that qN is likely to be more sensitive than ETR. It 
exhibited a sharp decrease from 119.0% (l1) to 61.1% (l2), followed by a 
steady decline to 7.1% (l11). Fig. 2d reveals a large number of outliers 
under the initial light intensity, which is consistent with the pattern 
observed for ETR. This phenomenon suggests that plants may exhibit a 
vigorous response during photosynthesis when transitioning from dark 
to light environments in two different growth conditions. The distribu -
tion of phenotype values for qN gradually became more concentrated as 
the light intensity increased. Interestingly, the trend of qN distribution 
was opposite to that of ETR, indicating that qN is more sensitive to 
changes in light intensity compared to ETR.3.3. Population structure and kinship
A total of 4,996,309 high-quality SNPs were utilized to define sub-
populations using the EM algorithm through Admixture. The optimal 
number of subpopulations, as predicted by cross-validation (Fig. 3a), 
was determined to be K 6. These six subgroups consisted of 5 (4.9%), 
12 (11.8%), 40 (39.2%), 12 (11.8%), 11 (10.8%), and 22 (21.6%) in-
dividuals, respectively (Fig. 3b). The majority of individuals were found 
to have a common population origin, indicating that the influence of 
population structure in subsequent analyses may be insignificant. We 
found that this population included three major groups, which were

6different along the first principal component (PC) in PC analysis, and the 
largest group included 65.7% of the individuals (Fig. 3c). This finding 
provides additional confirmation that the influence of population 
structure can be disregarded. The kinship matrix was subsequently uti-
lized for population correction in association models using EmMax 
software (Fig. 3d). The median value of genetic relationship of 102 
samples was 0.071, 86.9% of the kinship values were less than 0.2, 
46.3% of the samples were unrelated (Fig. 3d), which displayed that the 
influence of genetic relationship should be faint. Furthermore, the ef-
fects of population structure and kinship on the samples under different 
light intensities were analyzed using three GWAS models: GLM, KM, and 
QKM (equation (9)). Taking ETR and qN under the second group of light 
intensity as an example, the quantile-quantile plot of ETR (Fig. S2a) 
revealed that all three models underestimated  log10P, although 
some SNPs from the GLM model still fell within the confidence interval 
(gray area). In the quantile-quantile plot of qN (Fig. S2b), the screening 
result of the GLM model was superior, while the other two models failed 
to identify significant loci. In conclusion, for the 102 Populus simonii 
samples, the influence of population structure and genetic relationship 
on ETR and qN could be neglected, leading to reduced model complexity 
and diminished errors.
3.4. DDS fitting
Biological growth adheres to fundamental principles of biophysics 
and biochemistry. Various equations, such as the Gompertz, Logistic, 
Korf, and others, have been proven to effectively describe the patterns of 
complex quantitative traits, including photosynthesis traits (West et al., 
2001 ; Gu et al., 2016 ; Anderson et al., 2021 ). ETR and qN, which serve 
as key indicators of the intrinsic characteristics of photosynthesis, 
interact with each other to optimize the utilization of light (Zhao et al., 
2017 ). The optimization strategy of ETR and qN can be interpreted by 
considering phenotypes as dynamic systems. Given their potential in-
teractions, we introduce Lotka-Volterra (LV) differential equations to jointly model the relationship between ETR and qN. LV differential 
equations, originally developed by White in 1924 and Volterra in 1928, 
were initially used to describe the ecological interaction between two 
species, with one acting as a predator and the other as prey. However, 
these equations have been extended to model interactions in nonliving 
systems as well (Krumbeck et al., 2021 ; Paczkowski et al., 2021 ; Stone, 
2016 ). The forms of Logistic, Korf, and LV equations can be found in the 
Supplementary Materials . The numeric experiments (Supplementary 
Table 1) indicates that the logistic model can accurately describe the 
trend of ETR, while the Korf model effectively captures the trend of qN. 
DDS allows us to explore the genetic mechanism underlying their 
interaction in PSII and exhibits better fitting performance on the two 
phenotypes compared to the Korf and logistic models (Table 1). The 
fitting performance is evaluated using Coefficient of Determination (R2), 
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Hannan-Quinn criterion (HQ), 
with better performance indicated by an R2 closer to 1, a smaller AIC, 
and a smaller HQ. Moreover, the DDS model can accurately describe the 
inherent developmental trend and degree of interaction between the 
phenotypes through various parameters.
3.5. QTL mapping by dynamic differential system
From our numerical experiments (Supplementary Table S1), we 
discovered that the growth of ETR followed a logistic trend, while the 
growth of qN exhibited a Korf trend as the light intensity increased. The 
growth trend of each sample was accurately captured by the DDS model. 
The fitting curves (refer to Fig. 4a and b) demonstrated that the DDS 
model effectively captured the mean values of both ETR and qN. In the 
experimental environment, an allometric growth relationship was 
observed between ETR and qN during the process of photosynthesis. The 
promoting effect of qN on ETR gradually increased and eventually sta-
bilized at approximately 0.29, contributing to 26.7% of the total growth 
(Fig. 4a). This finding highlights the significant role of qN in enhancing 
ETR and influencing the overall growth dynamics of photosynthesis.

Lu et al.

7However, the positive effect of ETR on qN increased initially and 
reached its maximum when the logarithm of light intensity was 6. 
Subsequently, the effect gradually decreased but still played a positive 
role (Fig. 4b). These results highlight a unique allometric "symbiotic" 
relationship throughout the entire process of photosynthesis. The inde-
pendent growth had a dominant influence on ETR (Fig. 4c), while qN 
was significantly affected by ETR (Fig. 4d). This illustrates the interac -
tion between ETR and qN in promoting the smooth progression of 
photosynthesis. However, the positive role in enhancing the light pro-
tection ability would be weakened if the value of ETR became too large, 
possibly due to the plants ’ photoprotection capacity.
The joint process of independent and interactive growth is further 
analyzed by considering potential genetic components, represented as 
QTLs, using genome-wide SNP information. A QTL is considered sig-
nificant according to the hypothesis test (10) and is referred to as a "pivotal pleiotropic QTL" as it governs the interactions between ETR and 
qN. We characterized the influence of a pivotal pleiotropic QTL by 
estimating and testing parameters  

across different genotypes to understand how pivotal 
pleiotropic QTLs influence the relative contributions of competition and 
cooperation between ETR and qN. Furthermore, we determined the 
critical thresholds for QTL detection by examining Manhattan plots of 
test statistic values, taking into account the segregation information 
available. These thresholds allowed us to identify significant QTLs with 
statistical confidence. Fig. 5presents the results of this analysis, high-
lighting the genomic regions associated with these significant QTLs. For 
example, our DDS model identified 78 QTLs with threshold sig1 10 14

8identified with sig1, all of which are located within candidate genes. The 
majority of significant QTLs are found on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 8, and 
14. Notably, some QTLs, such as QTL3595368 and QTL3615022, are 
located within the same gene (as depicted in Fig. 5a). This gene encodes 
a protein that shares similarities with animal presenilin and is known to 
be influenced by potassium (K) deficiency. These findings suggest that 
the regulation mechanism of this gene on ETR and qN may be linked to 
the concentration of potassium in the surrounding environment. We also 
conducted a series of GWAS analyses on the two traits under 11 different 
light intensities, separately. We screened the 300 most significant loci 
for each phenotype under each light intensity and compared the overlap 
of QTLs between the DDS framework and the GWAS method. The GWAS 
method calculates the significance of loci by establishing a static asso-
ciation between a set of phenotypes and genotypes. Therefore, per-
forming GWAS analysis on two sets of phenotypes under 11 sets of light 
intensities results in 22 sets of screening results. Fig. 5b displays part of 
the GWAS results, showing the boxplot of the two traits and the Man-
hattan plot under the 9th light intensity. The overall emergence of QTLs 
with the GWAS method is depicted in Fig. 5c. We identified 45 common 
QTLs between the DDS framework and the GWAS method, confirming 
the effectiveness of the DDS framework to some extent. These 45 QTLs 
may play important roles in both static conditions with a specific light 
intensity and dynamic processes. The presence of different QTLs iden-
tified by the DDS framework and the GWAS method highlights the 
complexity of the regulatory mechanisms in a dynamic environment.3.6. Genetic control of ETR-qN interactions
Based on the significant effects of identified QTLs under threshold 
sig2, we estimated the parameters of DDS model with different geno-
types for ETR and qN, and calculated the phenotypic variation explained 
(PVE) under 11 light intensities by quantifying the dynamic genetic 
contribution to ETR and qN variation. In general, the effect of light in-
tensity on PVEs of ETR differed from qN, with the PVEs of ETR gradually 
increasing with the increase of light intensities at initial, when the light 
intensity continued to increase before the fourth group (’yl4’), the PVEs 
then increased slightly but became more dispersed (Fig. 6a and b). Ac-
cording to the identified QTLs, when the environment shifted from dark 
to light, the control to qN was more susceptible to changes in light in-
tensity. The PVEs then stabilized around 20 when the light intensity 
gradually increased (Fig. 6c and d). Hierarchical clustering was per-
formed based on the PVE values of identified QTLs under 11 different 
light intensities, and the dynamic changes of these QTLs with light in-
tensity were divided into several distinct stages, represented by different 
colors (Fig. 6e and f). The variation progress of ETR was divided into two 
groups: low light intensities and high light intensities (Fig. 6e). On the 
other hand, the variation progress of qN was divided into three groups: 
the first group consisted of light intensities, followed by medium and 
high light intensities (Fig. 6f). This division further revealed that the 
sensitivity to light intensities differed between ETR and qN: qN was 
more susceptible when exposed to light, while ETR was more likely to be

We interpreted the genetic features of one representative locus, QTL 
chr3/3242856, which exhibited three genotypes: GG, GT, and TT. This 
QTL is located on the candidate gene Potri.003G026800, which is 
associated with hydrolase activity, omega peptidase activity, and 
Peptidase C26 (Supplementary Table S2). These enzymes potentially 
play a role in regulating tree metabolism and controlling photosynthesis. 
The interaction between ETR and qN contributes to the advancement of 
photosynthesis, implying that the QTL may exert control over ETR and 
qN by regulating these enzymes. Fig. 6a clearly demonstrates that in-
dividuals with different genotypes for each trait exhibit a similar general 
growth pattern, albeit with varying upper limits. Relative to ETR, the QTL has a much more pronounced effect on qN growth, as shown by a 
noted difference in the shape of the qN growth curve among three ge-
notypes (Fig. 7b). The analysis revealed that QTL chr3/3242856 had 
genetic effects on both independent and dependent growth, but the 
impacts differed (Fig. 7). Independent growth was the primary factor 
influencing the growth of ETR, except in samples with genotype TT 
where the interactive component briefly exceeded the independent 
component (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the situation was distinct for qN, 
indicating that the interactive component had a more significant impact 
on qN compared to ETR at this specific QTL (Fig. 7b).

103.7. QTL network
Fig. 8illustrates the interaction mechanism between ETR and qN by 
showing four genetic networks constructed with pivotal pleiotropic 
QTLs under two thresholds. We define the QTLs that govern others as 
controllers. The set of controllers is denoted as CEN1 (controllers of the 
ETR network under the threshold sig1), CEN2 (controllers of the ETR 
network under the threshold sig2), CqN1 (controllers of the qN network 
under the threshold sig1), and CqN2 (controllers of the qN2 network 
under the threshold sig2), respectively. Both sets of CEN1 and CEN2 
exceed 40% (Fig. 7e), showing that these controllers may influence ETR 
variation not only through links with other QTLs but also through their own gene function. For example, NO.10 (QTL369581) is located on 
candidate gene Potri.001G255000 which governs protein binding, tet-
ratricopeptide repeat, and DnaJ domain. Other controllers of ETR 
network are not located on candidate genes, but most are close to 
candidate genes, which may work as promoters or terminators to pro-
duce effects (Jolma et al., 2013 ) or may directly participate in gene 
transcription as cis regulatory elements. It is worth noticing that there 
are multiple circular pathways in Fig. 8a, such as NO.12 (QTL444156) → 
NO.109 (QTL2443671) → NO.50 (QTL1171541) → NO.12 
(QTL444156), showing a dynamic balance system in the genetic regu-
lation of photosynthesis. In addition, pivotal pleiotropic QTLs can be 
controlled through the transmission of secondary QTLs, such as

13regulatory pathway NO.50 → NO.250 (QTL4956439) →  NO.109. The 
network reflects the complexity and integrity of the genetic regulation 
during photosynthesis. Some QTLs are located within candidate gene 
intervals, which can be used to explain their specific regulation mech -
anisms of ETR. For example, NO.68 (QTL1607860) is associated with 
the candidate gene Potri.005G053100, which encodes a hydrolase that 
acts on the ester bond. This hydrolase might catalyze certain reactions in 
PSII or regulate the growth of ETR by modifying the pH value and 
temperature of PSII. NO.94 (QTL2283536) is involved in controlling 
iron binding and the activity of an oxidoreductase, which acts on paired 
donors, combining or reducing with molecular oxygen. This activity 
could potentially affect the hydrolysis process by influencing the activity 
of the redox reaction, subsequently impacting the trend of ETR. Simi-
larly, NO.73 (QTL1956825), NO.96 (QTL2308856), NO.133 
(QTL3043713), and NO.212 (QTL4157232) regulate changes in ETR by 
controlling proteins. With a tightened threshold sig2 (Fig. 7b), NO.50 
and NO.109 govern 59.9% of the paths in the network. Furthermore, we 
observed that NO.14 (QTL439887) plays a crucial role in the tightened 
network instead of NO.12. The physical positions of NO.14 and NO.12 
are very close, suggesting that they may be located within the same 
regulatory region. QTLs located in non-coding regions can indirectly 
influence the expression of final proteins by regulating QTLs in coding 
regions. In some extent, NO.14 holds more significance than NO.12 and 
NO.62 (QTL1525231), which indirectly control other QTLs through 
NO.12 and NO.62. This indicates that non-controllers can have signifi -
cant genetic effects on the changes of ETR and qN by interacting with 
other QTLs. This genetic mechanism aligns with genetic analyses con-
ducted on forest root systems in 2021, as reported in Cell Reports (Wang 
et al., 2021 ).
From Fig. 8c, NO.1 (QTL133309), NO.220 (QTL4266141) and 
NO.244 (QTL4867125) govern most QTLs in the network of qN, among 
which NO.1 and NO.244 are bidirectional and mutually controlled, and 
some QTLs are regulated by multiple QTLs, such as NO.220 →  NO.135 
(QTL3057387) → NO.225 ← NO.244. When the threshold is tightened, 
the controllers might change, as shown in Fig. 8d. Since some original 
QTLs are not included under threshold sig2, NO.237 (QTL4760793) has 
become as controller, which is regulated by NO.175 (QTL3812183) and 
NO.244 in the original network (Fig. 8c). This phenomenon indicates 
that the controllers in the network primarily impact qN through links 
with other QTLs. However, NO.199 (QTL3844928) remains significant 
under both thresholds (Fig. 8e), demonstrating similar importance to the 
controllers in the ETR network. Additionally, more than 50% of the 
controllers in the qN regulatory network are located within coding re-
gions. For example, NO.1 (QTL133309) is located on the intron region of 
chromosome 1, the corresponding gene encodes transmembrane protein 
14C in Populus Tomentosa, and its homologous genes in Arabidopsis 
thaliana control the fatty acid transport of mediators. The QTL might 
control the value of qN by affecting transmembrane transport. NO.135 
(QTL3057387) contributes to the progress of DNA binding, and the 
homologous gene in Arabidopsis Thaliana, AT3G24650, known as ABI3, 
is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll. NO.220 
(QTL4266141) is also located at the coding region and encodes glyco -
syltransferase. NO.131 (QTL3043608) is located on the intron region of 
chromosome 11. The homologous gene in Arabidopsis thaliana controls 
atypical kinase to play an important role on plant salt tolerance by 
regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS). This QTL may be relevant to 
the process of reactive oxygen species regulating PSII. It is noteworthy 
that NO.94 and NO.133 have significant impact on both regulatory 
network of ETR and qN, which can be inferred that the two QTLs should 
occupy pivotal pleiotropic position in the processes of photosynthesis.
Although the controllers in the network of QTL and qN have no 
intersection, they adjust or be adjusted each other by complex network 
relationship (Fig. 8g). For a QTL, a link is said to be outgoing if this QTL 
activates or inhibits other QTLs, or incoming if it is activated or inhibited 
by other QTLs. Outgoing and incoming links reflect different roles of a 
QTL playing in network structure and behavior. We counted the total number of outgoing and incoming links for each QTL in the network 
under thresholds sig1 and sig2, and visualized the distribution respec -
tively (Fig. 8f–h, i). The numbers of outgoing links differed greatly 
across controllers, ranging from 1 to 203 (sig1) and 1 to 62 (sig2) 
respectively, reflecting different controllers occupied different positions 
in the regulatory network: most controllers can only regulate one or 
several QTLs, while dominant QTLs, such as NO.12 and NO.109 in the 
network of ETR under threshold sig1(Fig. 7h), controlled over 200 links 
to other QTLs, the situation in Fig. 7i was similar with that in Fig. 7h. All 
controllers in the ETR network turned to be secondary in the network of 
qN, that was true with controllers in the qN network. The above results 
ulteriorly proved the conclusion in Fig. 8g: controllers regulating ETR 
were not the same as those regulating qN, but they worked together to 
balance the dynamic interaction between ETR and qN both through 
mutual regulation but also through direct action of themselves.
3.8. Genetic effects of pivotal pleiotropic QTLs
We utilized the genetic effects to examine the characteristics of 
several pivotal pleiotropic QTLs (Fig. 9). For example, the effects of 
general growth and independent growth on NO.14 initially increased 
and then decreased when the log value of light intensity exceeded 3.6 
(Fig. 9a and b). Interestingly, different pivotal pleiotropic QTLs exhibi -
ted diverse patterns. All effects on NO.109 remained negative 
throughout the entire process, while independent growth gradually 
surpassed general growth at NO.22. The other three QTLs demonstrated 
both additive and dominant effects, resulting in more complex patterns. 
For instance, NO.131 and NO.237 displayed general synclastic additive 
effects (red solid lines) and opposite dominant effects (purple dotted 
lines). Moreover, the general effects (both additive and dominant) of all 
six QTLs exhibited inflection points (Fig. 9b), indicating that the effects 
of QTLs might weaken when the log value of light intensity exceeded a 
specific value, typically between 3 and 5. For certain QTLs like NO.14 
and NO.109, the controlling trend reversed after the inflection points, 
whereas for NO.237, stabilization was observed when the log value of 
light intensity exceeded 5.5.
Different from the circumstances in ETR, the independent growths in 
qN were more dispersed, as observed in NO.14 and NO.22. Notably, 
among the controllers of qN (Fig. 9c and d), the trend of additive in-
dependent growth remained consistent: negative. This suggests that 
these QTLs might govern the decrease of qN to ensure smooth plant 
photoreaction. On the other hand, additive interactions increased qN to 
enhance light protection capabilities. Dominant effects further adjusted 
the effects to help qN achieve a state of equilibrium.
In nature, various interactions occur among different populations. 
Similarly, interactions among phenotypes-phenotypes, phenotypes-ge -
notypes, and genotypes-genotypes are common during the growth pro-
cess of organic organisms (Jiang et al., 2018 ; Fu et al., 2018 ). As a 
complex system, photosynthesis maintains dynamic balance through 
numerous physical and chemical processes, including interactions be-
tween phenotypes. By utilizing the DDS model, we have successfully 
quantified the dynamic effects of QTLs (Fig. 8e). Therefore, we propose 
implementing a dynamic classification by dividing their genetic effects 
using an innovative vertical coordinate system as shown in Fig. 8e. The 
vertical coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants: I (blue area), II 
(pink area), III (green area), and IV (yellow area). Each quadrant rep-
resents an interaction mode: 
I. mutualism, ETR and qN benefit from one another;
II. parasitism-1, qN benefits at the cost of ETR;
III. competition, ETR and qN are harmful to each other;
IV. parasitism-2, ETR benefits at the cost of qN.
Now, let’s explain how to apply our method to classify the QTLs 
using the six pivotal pleiotropic QTLs shown in Fig. 9a, b, c, d as ex-
amples. When the curve falls within the yellow area, it indicates that the K. Lu et al.

15corresponding QTL has a positive effect on ETR but negatively affects 
qN. QTL22, QTL109, QTL131, and QTL237 exhibit single modes where 
the majority of the curves are located in one specific area. On the other 
hand, QTL14 and QTL50 have more complex situations, with curves 
passing through two or three areas as the light intensity increases. This 
suggests that the expression of these QTLs is influenced by light in-
tensity. The additive independent effects consistently fall within one 
area for all QTLs, while the interactive effects show more diversity. 
Notably, the two effects consistently occur in opposite directions, indi-
cating a regulatory mechanism that maintains balance in photosyn -
thesis. Dominant effects are significantly higher than additive effects in 
QTLs that exhibit both dominant and additive effects, suggesting that 
dominant effects may play an important role in groups with three ge-
notypes. The six pivotal pleiotropic QTLs represent mutualism type 
(QTL22, 131, 237), competition type (QTL109), and comprehensive 
type (QTL14, 50), illustrating the diverse genetic mechanisms underly -
ing ETR and qN. This classification extends the traditional static division 
to a dynamic pattern, allowing us to specifically study the regulation of 
different QTLs during photosynthesis.
3.9. Simulation calculation
To verify the utility of the DDS model, we conducted a series of 
simulation analysis to mimic the real example of Populus simonii as 
described above. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the accuracy of QTL map-
ping by using the DDS framework (Fig. S3a). Our model showed excel -
lent performance under most conditions that the AUC value was lower 
than 0.5 only when sample size n 30 and H2 0.05. The identification 
effects were improved with higher heritability and larger sample size. In 
Fig. 9a, a group with sample size n 100 reached an accuracy higher 
than 0.99 even with a low heritability 0.05. This result further confirmed 
the applicability of our model as the true sample size was 102 (Fig. S3b).
We implemented another simulation experiment with sample size n 
102 to explore the fitting properties under different heritability and 
drew the growth curves of two traits. The parameter estimation results 
were shown in Supplementary Table S3. With the increase in genetic 
heritability, the precision improved, the standard deviation of various 
parameters declined, and the simulation effect became more stable 
(Figs. S3c and d).
The trends of the estimated curves of two simulations were consistent 
with those of the real curves (Figs. S3c and d), which suggested that the 
genotype-specific curves estimated were reasonably convincing. The 
simulation effect of the estimated curve of 0.10 heritability was obvi-
ously better than that of the estimated curve of 0.05 heritability, when 
H2 0.20, the effect of simulation was nearly consistent with real effect, 
indicating that traits with higher heritability were more robust for DDS 
model. Even traits with low heritability could be well explained in 
general trend, which further proved stability of our model.
4.Discussion
Photosynthesis is one of the most important chemical reactions on 
Earth, and understanding its genetic mechanism is crucial for improving forestry production and even the development of bionic machinery. 
Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, including our research objects 
ETR and qN, reflect the interactive characteristics in PSII where oxygen 
evolution by oxidation occurs during the process of photosynthesis 
(Young et al., 2016 ; Shimada et al., 2022 ). ETR and qN, being complex 
traits, involve genetic and environmental components along with their 
intricate interactions (Wang et al., 2021 ). Various methods, such as 
GWAS and system mapping, have been widely applied to visualize the 
genetic patterns of complex traits in plants, animals, microorganisms, 
and even humans. Through these methods, thousands of QTLs have been 
discovered to play important roles in trait formation (Risch et al., 1996 ; 
Klein et al., 2005 ; Cai et al., 2021 ; Hazzouri et al., 2019 ; Shimada et al., 
2022 ; Tang et al., 2018 ; Fang et al., 2017 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 
2016 ; Scholz et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2011 ; Bo et al., 2014 ; Sun and Wu, 
2015 ). In this article, we implemented the DDS model into system 
mapping to characterize not only the direct effects of QTLs on pheno -
types but also their impact on interactions, providing a general tool for 
research on complex traits.
The DDS framework focuses on the genetic mechanisms that govern 
the interactions between complex traits, which is well suited for 
capturing the dynamics of the entire process (Fig. 4a, b, c, d). It is 
particularly powerful in detecting QTLs that play a role in the biological 
coordination of competition and cooperation.
We have successfully identified 250 QTLs under threshold sig1 and 
78 QTLs under threshold sig2 in a natural population of Populus simonii 
with a sample size of n 102 (Fig. 5a). Many of these QTLs have been 
found to be located near candidate genes with well-defined biological 
functions and have been interpreted through gene annotations. For 
example, QTL3043608 controls an atypical kinase, resulting in a sig-
nificant effect on plant salt tolerance through the regulation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, as a controller, this QTL governs 
numerous other QTLs while also being controlled by QTL4760793 
simultaneously (Supplementary Table S2, Fig. 8d). This phenomenon 
provides valuable insights into the functioning of genetic mechanisms. 
Additionally, we identified 45 QTLs that were detected by both the DDS 
framework and the GWAS method (Fig. 5), further supporting the 
robustness of our findings. Another significant discovery is that non- 
controllers (QTLs that are activated or inhibited) can have a signifi -
cant genetic impact on ETR or qN through their regulation with other 
QTLs, particularly when the threshold is tightened (Fig. 8). By analyzing 
two mapping experiments of Populus simonii , we have discovered that 
networks can be employed to dissect the interactions between ETR and 
qN. Interestingly, even though the controllers in ETR and qN do not 
intersect, they work together to balance the dynamic interaction 
through their direct actions and mutual regulation.
Genetic effects further help us trace the dynamic impact of pivotal 
pleiotropic QTLs as light intensity increases (Fig. 9a, b, c, d). Different 
QTLs exhibit a great diversity during the dynamic regulation process, 
but there are also some commonalities, such as inflection points and 
regulatory direction. These discoveries have inspired us to innovate a 
new way to classify QTLs using a dynamic pattern (Fig. 9e). With this 
classification, we can clearly depict the impact of a QTL throughout the 
entire process of photosynthesis, rather than using traditional static 
methods. Furthermore, simulation experiments demonstrate good Fig. 9.Genetic effects of six pivotal pleiotropic QTLs and a dynamic approach for the classification of pivotal pleiotropic QTLs. a The regulatory relationship

16statistical characteristics and high specificity (Fig. S3a). Our model 
achieves high accuracy even with small heritability, as long as the 
sample size exceeds 100. The fitting effects of the DDS model are vali-
dated through numerical experiments (Fig. S3b), and the results show 
even better performance with higher heritability.
5.Conclusions
The DDS framework offers a powerful tool for researchers to inves -
tigate the genetic mechanisms underlying interactions among complex 
traits. Moreover, it can be generalized to high-dimensional types, 
allowing for the development of more precise predictive models for 
dynamics and evolutionary rules. Although this paper focuses on chlo-
rophyll fluorescence parameters, the underlying principles of the DDS 
framework are applicable to various other aspects of interaction studies, 
including photosynthetic phenotypes, growth phenotypes, and more. 
Modern genetic mapping studies have reached a stage where their 
integration into diverse disciplines of biology is crucial to maximize 
their utility (Donnet and Samson, 2013 ). Furthermore, new discoveries 
in genetic mapping have propelled advancements in other fields such as 
dynamics, mechanics, and bionics (Schreier et al., 2015 ; Lewis, 2016 ; 
Cai et al., 2021 ). There is no doubt that the results obtained from our 
model can contribute to a better understanding of the genetic mecha -
nisms driving the evolution of trait interactions. These findings have the 
potential to advance relevant fields, including the study of interactive 
actions.
