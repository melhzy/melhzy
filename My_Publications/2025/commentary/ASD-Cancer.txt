ABSTRACT Deep learning is revolutionizing biomedical research by facilitating the 
integration of multi-omics data sets while bridging classical bioinformatics with existing 
knowledge. Building on this powerful potential, Zhang et al. proposed a semi-supervised 
learning framework called Autoencoder-Based Subtypes Detector for Cancer (ASD-can­
cer) to improve the multi-omics data analysis (H. Zhang, X . Xiong, M. Cheng, et al., 
2024, mSystems 9:e01395-24, https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.01395-24 ). By utilizing 
autoencoders pre-trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas data, the ASD-cancer framework 
outperforms the baseline model. This approach also makes the framework scalable, 
enabling it to process new data sets through transfer learning without retraining. This 
commentary explores the methodological innovations and scalability of ASD-cancer 
while suggesting future directions, such as the incorporation of additional data layers 
and the development of adaptive AI models through continuous learning. Notably, 
integrating large language models into ASD-cancer could enhance its interpretability, 
providing more profound insights into oncological research and increasing its influence  
in cancer subtyping and further analysis.
KEYWORDS deep learning, autoencoder, transfer learning, multi-omics, cancer 
prognosis
Deep learning is transforming cancer data analytics by facilitating the integration 
of multi-omics data, thereby significantly  improving diagnosis, classification,  and 
personalized treatment strategies ( 1–4). The ASD-cancer framework exemplifies  this 
progress by utilizing autoencoders to extract survival-related features, categorize various 
cancer subtypes, and identify potential biomarkers ( 5). It combines gene expression 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with tumor microbiome profiles  using 
Poore et al. ’s microbiome profiling  technique ( 6). The framework is validated through 
external cohort testing with colon cancer data from Qatar and liver cancer data from 
China ( 7, 8). However, integrating multi-omics data, particularly tumor microbiome and 
transcriptome profiles,  remains a significant  challenge in cancer research ( 9–12). As 
discussed in the ASD-cancer study, conventional methods like principal component 
analysis (PCA) could not effectively  capture the complexity of multi-omics data sets ( 13, 
14). This limitation hinders the discovery of intricate biological patterns, highlighting the 
need for more advanced analytical approaches. ASD-cancer overcomes these limitations, 
enabling meaningful feature extraction and deeper biological insights. By identifying 
survival subtypes across 20 cancer types, ASD-cancer enhances risk stratification,  informs 
clinical decisions, and advances personalized oncology, marking a significant  step toward 
precision medicine.

ASD-CANCER FRAMEWORK: A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR TUMOR 
ANALYSIS
The ASD-cancer framework follows a structured, multiphase data processing pipeline. 
This method integrates autoencoders with random forest and various bioinformatics 
techniques, forming a semi-supervised framework for cancer subtype stratification  and 
possible biomarker identification  (see Fig. 1 ). This pipeline can be categorized into 
the following phases: data input and preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, 
subtype detection and survival analysis, subtype and clinical stage prediction, gene 
expression and microbial abundance association, and biological pathway identification.
The pipeline integrates RNA-seq and tumor microbiome data as new or test data. 
Data preprocessing ensures consistency and quality across multi-omics data sets 
through normalization.
Subsequently, autoencoders extract features from transcriptomic and microbiome 
data, capturing nonlinear relationships and reducing noise. Incorporating TCGA data 
sets enhances feature extraction effectiveness  and improves model generalizability 
for downstream analyses without retraining. The resulting 3,000 latent features per 
cancer type provide a richer biological context compared to traditional dimensionality 
reduction techniques like PCA. Cox proportional hazards regression filters  out non-infor­
mative features, ensuring that only statistically significant  survival-associated biomarkers 
contribute to subtype detection.
Following feature selection, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clusters patient 
data into biologically distinct survival subtypes, optimizing clustering stability through 
silhouette scoring. Then, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regres­
sion perform the prognostic relevance analysis of these subtypes, confirming  survival 
differences  between these cancer types.
After survival analysis, the chi-square test and random forest classifier  are employed 
to predict cancer subtypes and clinical stages using the features identified  in prior 
FIG 1 Data flow  diagram of ASD-cancer. The ASD-cancer framework integrates multi-omics data, deep learning, and statistical modeling to identify cancer 
subtypes and assess survival outcomes. The workflow  begins with data loading and preprocessing RNA-seq and tumor microbiome data, incorporating TCGA 
data sets. Pre-trained ensemble autoencoders extract latent features, which undergo feature selection using Cox proportional hazards regression to retain 
survival-associated biomarkers. Subtype detection is conducted using GMM, followed by survival analysis that includes Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank 
tests, and Cox regression to validate subtype distinctions. Subtype and stage prediction are conducted using the chi-square test and random forest classifier.  
Pearson correlation analysis examines associations between gene expression and microbial abundances, while gene enrichment analysis identifies  biological 
pathways and potential biomarkers for cancer prognosis and treatment.Commentary mSystems

steps. This semi-supervised learning approach integrates the large-scale TCGA data set 
with smaller, heterogeneous cohorts, enhancing subtype classification  generalization by 
improving feature quality and reducing noise.
Beyond subtype classification,  Pearson correlation analysis is applied to identify 
associations between gene expression profiles  and microbial abundances, offering  a 
deeper understanding of potential tumor-microbiome interactions. This step aims to 
identify molecular signatures associated with cancer progression.
Finally, gene enrichment analysis is performed to identify molecular pathways 
and functional annotations associated with detected subtypes. This final  step reveals 
potential biomarkers and mechanistic insights that may inform cancer prognosis and 
therapeutic strategies.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR DEEP LEARNING IN ONCOLOGY
The ASD-cancer framework has effectively  showcased the potential of transfer learning 
implementation for enhanced multi-omics cancer data analysis. Future research could 
involve additional data layers, such as proteomics, metabolomics, medical imaging, and 
clinical data, to further test the effectiveness  of transfer learning with even more data 
modalities. Expanding data integration in this way offers  an endless opportunity to 
deepen our understanding of cancer dynamics, further addressing critical gaps and 
uncovering new insights.
In addition to data integration, another crucial area to enhance this study is the 
incorporation of adaptive deep learning frameworks for continuous learning. Building on 
the foundations of ASD-cancer, these continuous learning modules connect live clinical 
and multimodal data for real-time predictive analysis in alignment with the latest cancer 
research and treatment investigations.
Enhancing interpretability is another critical direction for ASD-cancer improvement. 
While the framework has shown impressive performance in survival subtyping and 
classification,  the intermediate and final  outputs require greater explainability. One 
promising approach is integrating large language models and ASD-cancer to produce 
natural language explanations of these outputs ( 15). This integration would help to 
connect the gap between complex data sets, AI-driven insights, and clinical decision-
making, potentially making results more intuitive and translating ASD-cancer’s findings 
into actionable interventions.
CONCLUSION
The ASD-cancer framework integrates deep learning, machine learning, and bioinformat­
ics while utilizing TCGA data through transfer learning to investigate multi-omics cancer 
data, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and result reliability. Its semi-supervised 
architecture extracts survival-related features from such complex data sets, identifying 
distinct subtypes across 20 cancer types. The framework outperforms the baseline 
model in cancer risk stratification  and provides biologically meaningful insights into 
host gene expression-microbiome interactions. The ASD-cancer framework offers  a 
robust foundation for understanding tumor microenvironment dynamics and enhanc­
ing the reliability of risk stratification.  By leveraging its artificial  neural network archi­
tecture to integrate diverse multi-omics data, ASD-cancer serves as a valuable and 
scalable platform for understanding tumor microenvironment dynamics, improving risk 
stratification,  and guiding future investigations into personalized treatment strategies.
