Background: Several studies have found that oral and gut microbiome and their
byproducts can impact Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The objective of our study is to
analyze metagenomic sequencing data from paired oral and fecal microbiomes, along
with clinical variables, to identify communities of bacteria associated with AD. This
research aims to improve our understanding of the microbiome community matrix, and
how these communities interact and correlate with AD status compared to healthy
controls (HC) through an oral-gut microbial axis.
Method: The study includes 223 HC and 43 individuals with AD. During each
visit, paired oral and fecal samples were collected, along with clinical variables.
Metagenomic profiling was done on all samples. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was
applied to identify differences in microbial species groups between these two body
sites in realtion to AD status. LDA is used as a topic modeling method to uncover the
complex structure and function of microbial communities. Subsequently, differential
abundance (DA) analysis was performed to identify species with differential
abundance at each body site.
Result: We identified microbiotal communities sharing similar characteristics and
pinpointed representative bacteria within these communities that are highly relevant
to AD. Within the oral microbiome, we have identified 27 topics, including several
bacteria that are highly relevant to AD. These included Alistipes (beta=3.919232e-01),
Paraprevotella xylaniphila (beta =1.227791e-01), Desulfovibrio (beta =6.013213e-
02), and Lachnospiraceae (beta =2.304369e-02). In the gut, we have identified 50
topics, reflecting the gut is more complex the oral microbiome. Notable bacteria in
the gut microbiome include Actinomyces oricola (beta=6.959554e-01), Roseburia (beta

=8.861444e-02), Bacteroidetes (beta =5.010610e-01), and Actinomyces gerencseriae
(beta=3.048668e-02).
Conclusion: Our study has identified a variety of bacteria that exhibit novel community
patterns that associate with AD. In the gut, A. gerencseriae and other oral microbiomes
were observed in AD patients. Also, the microbial communities differ between AD
and HC. Thereforth, we conclude that translocation of oral and gut microbiota may
contribute to AD through an oral-gut-microbiome axis.
