ABSTRACT2
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have transformed multimodal healthcare data integration by 3
capturing complex, non-Euclidean relationships across diverse sources such as electronic health4
records, medical imaging, genomic profiles, and clinical notes. This review synthesizes GNN5
applications in healthcare, highlighting their impact on clinical decision-making through multimodal6
integration, advanced fusion strategies, and attention mechanisms. Key applications include drug7
interaction and discovery, cancer detection and prognosis, clinical status prediction, infectious8
disease modeling, genomics, and the diagnosis of mental health and neurological disorders.9
Various GNN architectures demonstrate consistent applications in modeling both intra- and10
intermodal relationships. GNN architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph 11
Attention Networks, are integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), transformer-12
based models, temporal encoders, and optimization algorithms to facilitate robust multimodal 13
integration. Early, intermediate, late, and hybrid fusion strategies, enhanced by attention 14
mechanisms like multi-head attention, enable dynamic prioritization of critical relationships, 15
improving accuracy and interpretability. However, challenges remain, including data heterogeneity, 16
computational demands, and the need for greater interpretability. Addressing these challenges 17
presents opportunities to advance GNN adoption in medicine through scalable, transparent GNN 18
models. 19

INTRODUCTION
Graphs serve as fundamental mathematical structures for representing and analyzing the complex 23
relationships inherent in multimodal datasets. In the healthcare domain, nodes in a graph can represent 24
medical entities such as patients, diseases, genes, proteins, medications, and healthcare providers, while 25
edges capture the associations or interactions among them Paul et al. (2024). Node and edge features 26
may incorporate additional attributes, including patient demographic details, disease states, medical notes, 27
or medication properties Li et al. (2023a). Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques, 28

designed primarily for Euclidean data, often struggle to accommodate the non-Euclidean nature of relational 29
medical data. GNNs address this limitation by extending deep neural networks to graph-structured data by 30
aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes to learn high-order interactions through 31
methods such as contrastive, generative, and explainable GNNs Kumar et al. (2023b); Sefer (2025b,a); Cetin 32
and Sefer (2025). This enables GNNs to generate graph-level representations that capture the structural and 33
semantic complexity of medical data Lee et al. (2024a); Kumar et al. (2023b). GNNs have proven effective 34
in a wide range of healthcare applications, from disease diagnosis and comorbidity prediction to patient 35
referral optimization and emotional intelligence modeling in clinical settings Sangeetha et al. (2024); Pablo 36
et al. (2024); Wang (2022); Xu et al. (2024). 37
Healthcare data is inherently diverse and often available in multiple modalities, including structured 38
data like EHRs, unstructured data like clinical notes, and complex forms like medical images (MRI, 39
CT, PET, EEG, MEG), chemical, laboratory, temporal, and genomic data. Integrating and analyzing 40
these heterogeneous data sources is crucial for a holistic understanding of disease and patient conditions. 41
Multimodal learning, which aims to leverage complementary information from different modalities, is a 42
logical tool for incorporating these disparate data sources Waqas et al. (2024); Stahlschmidt et al. (2022); 43
Teoh et al. (2024); Dumyn et al. (2024). GNNs are particularly well suited for multimodal healthcare44
applications, as they can model the intricate relationships within and between these diverse data streams 45
and can be fused together with other deep learning or machine learning models Dawn et al. (2024); Paul 46
et al. (2024); Johnson et al. (2024). 47
This paper provides a review of the recent applications of GNNs in healthcare, with a specific focus on 48
approaches that incorporate multimodal data. We structure the review by grouping applications into key 49
themes: pharmacology, oncology, epidemiology, neuropsychiatry, clinical risk prediction, and genomics. 50
By examining the methodologies, findings, and challenges within each area, this review aims to offer a 51
comprehensive overview of the current landscape and potential future directions for GNNs in computational 52
healthcare. 53
We defined the scope in advance to include primary studies that (1) apply a graph neural network to a 54
biomedical or clinical task and (2) integrate at least two data modalities or combine graph learning with 55
other encoders within an explicit fusion scheme. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and arXiv for 56
studies published between January 2020 and August 2025 using combinations of graph-learning terms (e.g., 57
GNN, GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, heterogeneous graph), multimodality terms (e.g., multimodal, fusion), 58
and health-domain terms (e.g., clinical, oncology, pharmacology, genomics). Titles and abstracts were 59
screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by full-text assessment. We included 60
studies that reported the fusion strategy and described the architectural components used; single-modality 61
GNNs, non-health domains, and papers lacking full text were excluded. The search identified 121 records, 62
of which 85 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Because reporting practices 63
and evaluation metrics vary widely across domains, we used descriptive synthesis rather than quantitative 64
meta-analysis. Complete search strings and eligibility details are provided in the Supplementary Tables 65
(S1, S2, and S3).66

2 ONCOLOGY
Oncology-focused multimodal graph frameworks fuse histopathology, radiology, omics, and clinical 97
covariates to support diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning tasks (Table 3). Most systems 98
pair modality-specific encoders, such as (CNNs/ViTs or radiomics for images, text encoders for reports, 99
and pathway/interaction graphs for omics, with graph layers under intermediate fusion, frequently using 100
attention for weighting Kulandaivelu et al. (2024); Kim et al. (2023); Alzoubi et al. (2024); Pratap Joshi et al. 101
(2025); Yan et al. (2024); Gowri et al. (2024). Population graphs connect patients via various similarity 102
measures in imaging and clinical embeddings (head and neck, ovarian cancers), while pathways and 103
knowledge graphs encode gene–gene or entity relations for subtype and survival modeling Peng et al. 104
(2024); Ghantasala et al. (2024); Li et al. (2023b). Lesser used, late fusion is applied when independently 105
learned patient–gene bipartite embeddings are aligned for survival (MGNN) Gao et al. (2022), whereas early 106
fusion concatenates raw/image features before graph reasoning in lung and federated liver cancer models 107
Li et al. (2023b); Moharana et al. (2025). Beyond core oncology tasks, misinformation detection integrates 108
text encoders with R-GCN over medical knowledge graphs under early fusion Cui et al. (2020). These 109

fusion types Li et al. (2023a); Paul et al. (2024); Waqas et al. (2024). 112
3 NEUROPSYCHIATRY
Multimodal GNN frameworks extended to neurological domains have been applied to conditions such as 113
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, depression, autism spectrum disorder, Schizophrenia, and even 114
emotion recognition and sentiment analysis by integrating diverse linguistic, genomic, behavioral, imaging, 115
and physiological data Teoh et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2023a); Xu et al. (2024); Sangeetha et al. (2024); 116
Khemani et al. (2024). 117
Neuropsychiatry multimodal GNN pipelines unify imaging (fMRI/sMRI/DTI/PET), electrophysiology 118
(EEG), speech/text, and omics within subject or population-level graphs (Table 4). A common approach 119
in Alzheimer’s disease prediction integrates imaging-driven fusion with cross-attention Transformers 120
(CsAGP, GCNCS), dual hypergraphs (DHFWLSL), multiplex subject graphs (HetMed), and hypergraph 121
attention fusion (HCNN-MAFN) Tang et al. (2023a); Luo et al. (2024); Kim et al. (2023); Kumar et al. 122
(2023a); Lee et al. (2024b). Parkinson’s studies pair connectomic encoders with omics via attention 123
(JOIN-GCLA) and patient-similarity graphs (AdaMedGraph) Chan et al. (2022); Lian et al. (2023). 124
Autism Spectrum Disorder models treat rs-fMRI as signals on DTI graphs (M-GCN) to intermediate 125
spatio-temporal/demographic fusion (IFC-GNN) and V AE-aligned Transformer/Graph-U-Net encoders 126
(MM-GTUNets) D’Souza et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2024b); Cai et al. (2025). For Major Depressive 127
Disorder, interview-centric systems employ heterogeneous attention over audio–video–text (A VS-GNN, 128
DSE-HGAT), while imaging/population approaches (LGMF-GNN, FC-HGNN, Ensemble GNN) couple 129
local ROI graphs to global subject graphs Li et al. (2025, 2024); Liu et al. (2024); Gu et al. (2025); 130
Venkatapathy et al. (2023); Lee et al. (2024a). Schizophrenia pipelines tend to model EEG channel-graphs 131
and dual-branch DTI attention networks integrating FA/FN features Jiang et al. (2023); Gao et al. (2025a). 132
Attention weights filter population graphs based on their similarity, and learn multi-scale spatial–temporal 133
patterns by combining CNN/Transformer encoders with GNN message passing inside the fusion stack. 134
4 EPIDEMIOLOGY
Recent epidemic-forecasting and COVID-19 outcome models fuse temporal sequence encoders with 135
structure-aware GNNs (Table 5). For population-level spread, architectures stack temporal CNN/DNN 136
modules with attention-based GNN layers to capture local and global transmission patterns (MSGNN, 137
EpiGNN) and augment signals with LLM-derived social media features or dual topologies to improve 138
influenza forecasts (MGLEP, Dual-Topo-STGCN) Qiu et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2022); Tran et al. (2024); 139
Luo et al. (2025). Within hospitals, contact graphs linking patients and healthcare workers use GraphSAGE 140
and attention to model hospital-acquired infection transmission Gouareb et al. (2023). For COVID-19 141
prognosis, multimodal pipelines use attention to fuse CT-derived features with KNN population graphs 142
Keicher et al. (2023), while edge-flexible GCNN frameworks integrate imaging, tabular, and temporal 143
signals (CNN/LSTM and population GNN) to allow post-training edge adaptability Tariq et al. (2023, 144
2025). These models emphasize spatiotemporal message passing, attention for weighting neighbors and 145
signals, and adaptable graph construction to handle dynamic data. 146

5 CLINICAL
EHR-based multimodal graph frameworks aim to support clinical prediction and treatment planning through 147
merging diverse medical data modalities Li et al. (2022); Xu et al. (2024). When combined with knowledge 148
graphs, these models offer flexibility in terms of both inputs and prediction tasks Nye (2023); Rajabi and 149
Kafaie (2022). Most models integrate structured EHR (diagnoses, procedures, meds, labs, vitals) with at 150
least one unstructured or high-dimensional stream, be it clinical notes, medical images (CXR, fundus), 151
genomics, or wearable/sensor data, often via CNNs for imaging, TF-IDF/BioBERT for text, and temporal 152
trajectory layers for labs/vitals AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); Zedadra et al. (2025); Pablo et al. 153
(2024); Wang et al. (2025). The graph connectivity tends to be modeled as patient–patient similarity graphs, 154
knowledge graphs linking encounters to conditions, and heterogeneous graphs (e.g., sensor and metapath 155
views) (Table 6). Dynamic network edges implemented in conjunction with learned message-passing 156
connectivity from static KGs allow graphs to adapt to new information without the need for retraining Liu 157
et al. (2021); Valls et al. (2023); Gao et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025); Christos Maroudis et al. (2025). 158
In terms of multimodal fusion strategies, the majority of models start with modality-specific encoders 159
(CNNs for images, BiGRU/LSTM/Transformers for sequences/text), which are then integrated into 160
GNN backbones (GraphSAGE, GNN/GAT, heterogeneous GNN), with attention used both for cross- 161
modal weighting and within graph layers AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); Begum (2024); 162
Boschi et al. (2024); Ghanvatkar and Rajan (2023). Temporal structure can be modeled at the node level 163
(RNN/Transformer encoders per patient), edge level (temporal embeddings that define adaptive edges), 164
and graph level (dynamic GNNs that rebuild neighborhoods by top-k similarity each step). Disentangled 165
dynamic attention separates invariant vs. shifting patterns and fairness-aware designs Tang et al. (2023b); 166
Zhang et al. (2024); Christos Maroudis et al. (2025). 167
MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV are two of the most used datasets for mortality and length-of-stay prediction, 168
as well as readmission, sepsis trajectory modeling, and heart-disease graphs, integrated with similarity- 169
based measures, temporal encoders, dynamic graph update strategies, and privacy-preserving architectures 170
AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); Ghanvatkar and Rajan (2023); Christos Maroudis et al. (2025); 171
Begum (2024). Imaging-heavy models join population graphs with CNN/radiomics for tasks such as 172
ophthalmology and DR screening (APTOS, MESSIDOR) Gao et al. (2024); Zedadra et al. (2025), while 173
sensor-centric pipelines exploit heterogeneous sensor-and-knowledge graphs Wang et al. (2025). SHARE, 174
Synthea, and ANIC datasets support multitask longitudinal modeling, ER triage, and out-of-distribution 175
ICU biomarker forecasting Boschi et al. (2024); Valls et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2024). 176
By uniting EHR, imaging, genomic, temporal, and sensor-derived information within attention-based 177
graph representations, diagnostics and prognostic models capture both the relational and temporal 178
complexities inherent in patient care Oss Boll et al. (2024). Their reliance on attention-based fusion 179
and invariant pattern learning reflects a shift toward systems capable of modeling data heterogeneity and 180
distribution shifts, resulting in scalable and generalizable clinical decision-support systems. 181
6 GENOMICS
Across lncRNA–miRNA interaction prediction, GNN models implement sequence-aware fusion with 182
attention, built over heterogeneous similarity graphs (Table 7). Modalities and features typically 183
combine primary sequence (k-mers), similarity networks (sequence/functional/disease), and structural 184
or physicochemical descriptors into unified node–edge representations Wang et al. (2023b, 2022); Wang 185
and Chen (2023); Zhang et al. (2022). Sequence embeddings are often initialized via unsupervised 186

objectives (e.g., k-mer Doc2Vec) before graph learning, then refined with inductive backbones such 187
as GraphSAGE and attention layers to weight informative neighbors Wang et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. 188
(2022). Heterogeneous/bipartite graphs integrate lncRNA–miRNA and miRNA–disease with similarity 189
measures, structured probabilistic layers, or multi-channel attention Wang et al. (2022); Wang and Chen 190
(2023). Datasets such as LncACTdb, LNCipedia, miRBased, ncRNASNP, and HMDD are integrated into 191
pretrained sequence embeddings, heterogeneous similarity graphs, and attention-based GNNs to improve 192
link prediction fidelity and mechanistic interpretability of gene expression. 193
DISCUSSION
Healthcare data is inherently multimodal, and integrating information from different sources can provide a 194
more comprehensive view of a patient’s health status or disease characteristics. Graph Neural Networks 195
facilitate this by providing a framework to model relationships between and within each modality. The 196
strengths of GNNs lie in their integration with other deep learning models by taking advantage of advanced 197
fusion strategies, particularly those employing attention mechanisms. GNN integrations with CNNs, 198
RNNs, autoencoders, language transformers, machine learning classification or regression models, and 199
optimization algorithms facilitate multimodal data preprocessing and merging, as illustrated in the workflow 200
of fusion types in Figure 1. 201
Across research areas and prediction tasks, intermediate fusion is the prevailing design (Figure 2 Panels 202
A and B, and Figure 3 Panel B). In epidemic forecasting, temporal encoders fuse data via attention-based 203
graph layers to capture local and global spread Qiu et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2022); Tran et al. (2024); 204
Luo et al. (2025). Hospital-acquired infection models combine contact graphs with attention inside the 205
graph pipeline Gouareb et al. (2023). COVID-19 outcome prediction uses intermediate fusion that joins 206
CT features with population graphs with adaptable edges Keicher et al. (2023); Tariq et al. (2023, 2025). 207
Clinical prediction and operations also favor intermediate fusion, where modality-specific encoders precede 208
GraphSAGE, GCN, GAT, or heterogeneous GNN layers AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); Begum 209
(2024); Boschi et al. (2024); Valls et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2024); Christos Maroudis et al. (2025). 210
Oncology mostly follows the same pattern, with late fusion used when independent embeddings are aligned 211
after training and early fusion used when features are concatenated before graph reasoning Gao et al. 212
(2022); Li et al. (2023b); Moharana et al. (2025); Alzoubi et al. (2024); Pratap Joshi et al. (2025); Peng 213
et al. (2024); Yan et al. (2024). Gene expression studies implement sequence-aware intermediate fusion 214
that mixes pretrained sequence embeddings with similarity graphs and attention Wang et al. (2023b, 2022); 215
Wang and Chen (2023); Zhang et al. (2022). 216
Across the 85 studies reviewed, intermediate fusion accounts for 81% of models (n=69), with the highest 217
use in neuropsychiatry (83%) and pharmacology (74%), and attention layers are present in over 60% of 218
systems. Early fusion constitutes 15% (n=13), largely in oncology for raw feature concatenation. Late 219
fusion appears in 1% (n=1) for embedding alignment in genomics and hybrid fusion in 2% (n=2), both in 220
neuropsychiatry. Intermediate fusion is associated with the strongest outcomes, with top models reaching 221
mean AUC values near 0.95 and accuracies near 0.92 (Table 8). Early fusion supports simpler feature 222
integration with broader performance ranges (AUC 0.84–0.99), while late fusion suits alignment-driven 223
tasks such as MGNN, where modality-specific embeddings are correlated only after independent training 224
(AUC 0.98). Intermediate fusion consistently yields the most discriminative models, including Alzheimer’s 225
systems achieving AUC values up to 1.00, consistent with prior analyses of multimodal GNNs Paul et al. 226

miRBase, ncRNASNP, HMDD, and GENCODE, which support sequence pretraining and heterogeneous 238
graph construction Wang et al. (2023b, 2022); Wang and Chen (2023); Zhang et al. (2022). 239
The most prevalent layer types include GraphSAGE, GCN, GAT, and heterogeneous GNNs. Temporal 240
encoders at the node level include LSTM, GRU, and temporal GNNs. Attention is used to weight neighbors 241
and modalities. In epidemic forecasting, temporal encoders feed attention-based graph layers Qiu et al. 242
(2024); Xie et al. (2022); Tran et al. (2024); Luo et al. (2025). In clinical prediction, GraphSAGE and 243
heterogeneous GNNs are combined with BiGRU or Transformer text encoders and time-aware designs 244
AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); Begum (2024); Boschi et al. (2024). In oncology, attention 245
GNNs integrate imaging and omics Alzoubi et al. (2024); Peng et al. (2024); Yan et al. (2024). Gene 246
interaction models pair GraphSAGE with Doc2Vec k-mer embeddings, CRF layers, and multi-channel 247
attention Wang et al. (2023b, 2022); Wang and Chen (2023); Zhang et al. (2022). Alzheimer’s, COVID-19 248
Outcomes, and Drug-Target Prediction exhibit the highest layer type diversity, with 90%, 70%, and 60% of 249
the models respectively combining multiple layer types, reflecting their complex multimodal requirements, 250
as illustrated in the varied fusion strategies of Figure 3, Panel C. GNN + attention has the highest prevalence 251
across included studies (63%), with CNN/Conv following closely with an incidence of 40% across studies, 252
particularly in tasks like Alzheimer’s and COVID-19 outcomes. 253
Forecasting tasks tend to model spatiotemporal data using intermediate fusion that aligns mobility and 254
case signals with graph dynamics Qiu et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2022); Tran et al. (2024); Luo et al. (2025). 255
Operational and clinical tasks embed structured EHR, notes, images, and vitals with modality-specific 256
encoders, which are fused in graph layers with attention AL-Sabri et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2023b); 257
Valls et al. (2023); Ghanvatkar and Rajan (2023); Zhang et al. (2024); Christos Maroudis et al. (2025). 258
Neuropsychiatric tasks combine temporal encoders with imaging, electrophysiology, language, and omics 259
within subject or population graphs with attention mechanisms Cai et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2024); Li et al. 260
(2024). Temporal encoders concentrate on time-dependent problems, including epidemic forecasting (75%) 261
and COVID-19 outcomes (67%). A large overlap between attention mechanisms and temporal encoders 262
has been observed in epidemic forecasting (75% attention; 75% temporal), ICU length of stay, ovarian 263
cancer, prescription prediction, sepsis trajectory modeling, and neurodegenerative disease (Figure 2, Panel 264
D and Figure 3, Panel A). 265
Attention mechanisms and modality-specific encoders such as CNNs, RNNs, and graph layers that retain 266
spatial, temporal, and relational structure correspond to higher predictive reliability across biomedical 267
settings (Table 8. Attention-based intermediate fusion appears in most high-performing systems, particularly 268
in tasks requiring integration of structured molecular features, clinical text, and imaging. Architectures 269
combining GraphSAGE, GCN, or heterogeneous GNN layers with temporal or vision encoders achieve 270

the strongest AUC and accuracy ranges in genomics, neuropsychiatry, and oncology. Domains with well- 271
defined structural priors, such as ncRNA–miRNA prediction and drug–drug interaction modeling, show 272
tighter performance bounds, whereas models operating on heterogeneous EHR or epidemiological data 273
exhibit broader variability. 274
This review has several limitations. Marked heterogeneity in cohorts and nomenclature limits cross-study 275
comparability and meta-analytic potential. Our harmonized taxonomy (early/intermediate/late fusion, 276
layer families) may introduce classification error for mixed or sparsely described architectures, and many 277
abstractions rely on self-reported methods without code or full graph-construction details. External validity 278
is often weak, since numerous studies lack external validation. Widely used datasets (e.g., MIMIC, ADNI, 279
ABIDE, and public KGs) may carry sampling biases that may hinder generalization. Finally, we did 280
not apply a formal risk-of-bias tool or rerun models, as the main scope of this review is to build an 281
understanding of how multimodal medical data is being integrated in GNNs. 282
CONCLUSION
GNNs offer a robust framework for modeling complex relationships across diverse modalities such 283
as electronic health records, medical imaging, genomic profiles, and clinical notes. By synthesizing 284
advancements in drug discovery, cancer detection, mental health diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical risk 285
prediction, and gene expression analysis, this review has highlighted GNNs’ ability to enhance clinical 286
decision-making by leveraging graph-structured representations to capture intricate relationships among 287
patients, diseases, drugs, imaging, text, and biological entities. The integration of GNNs with deep 288
learning models, such as CNN, LSTM, RNN, dimensionality reduction, machine learning, and optimization 289
algorithms, enhances their ability to process diverse data modalities. Multiple fusion strategies, such as early, 290
intermediate, late, and hybrid, are employed to fuse multimodal data into a unified prediction framework. 291
However, data heterogeneity across modalities, varying in structure and noise levels, complicates graph 292
construction and fusion, while resource-intensive computations pose scalability issues. Interpretability and 293
causality are essential for clinical adoption, with attention-based mechanisms offering partial solutions but 294
requiring further development. Real-world use of multimodal GNNs also faces regulatory and operational 295
barriers. Many models rely on complex graph-construction choices and stochastic training procedures that 296
limit reproducibility across institutions, while the absence of standardized evaluation criteria complicates 297
regulatory review. Deployment requires attention to data governance, privacy compliance, and integration 298
with existing clinical workflows. Ensuring model generalizability across diverse datasets, addressing data 299
availability, and complying with ethical, privacy, and security regulations are additional constraints that are 300
yet to be fully addressed. 301
Several research directions follow from the patterns identified in this review. First, causal GNNs are 302
needed to disentangle mechanistic relations from observational correlations in multimodal biomedical 303
graphs, particularly for tasks such as treatment effect modeling, disease progression, and drug interaction 304
inference. Second, privacy-preserving federated graph learning is essential for cross-institutional 305
multimodal datasets. Third, the field lacks standardized explainability benchmarks for subgraph attribution, 306
modality-specific contribution, and stability under perturbation, which would allow systematic comparison 307
across fusion architectures. Lastly, future benchmarks should evaluate fusion strategies under controlled 308
data heterogeneity to determine when early, late, or hybrid designs offer measurable advantages to ensure 309
that multimodal GNNs are mechanistically informative, privacy-aligned, and reproducible at clinical scale. 310

Figure 1. Conceptual workflow of multimodal fusion strategies. Early, intermediate, and late fusion
integrate heterogeneous inputs for downstream prediction tasks. In early fusion, modalities are concatenated
or pooled up front and passed to a unified encoder. In intermediate fusion, each modality is first processed
by a modality-specific encoder, and features are combined mid-model via attention/GNN layers. In late
fusion, separate modality/GNN branches are trained, and their scores are combined only at the decision
stage. Prediction layers are dominated by fully connected layers, multiple-layer perceptrons, or machine
learning classifiers.
