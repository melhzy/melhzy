## About Me

I apply artificial intelligence and deep learning to advance understanding of Alzheimer's disease and complex heterogeneous conditions. My research integrates multimodal data, such as microbiome profiles, blood biomarkers, immune measures, metabolomics, clinical records, and scientific literature, using statistical learning, machine learning, and large language models. I develop frameworks that combine computational approaches with biological insights to improve disease understanding and inform future therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

## Research Program

### ADAM (Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model)

**ADAM-1** (published IEEE Access, 2025): Multi-agent reasoning framework combining large language models with ensemble classifiers for AD classification, integrating microbiome and clinical data with explainable AI.

**ADAM-2** (in development): Expanding to oral/gut microbiomes, peripheral biomarkers, immune profiles, metabolomics, and neuroimaging within the ATN (Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration) framework. Fine-tuning domain-specific language models using LoRA/QLoRA with retrieval-augmented generation.

**Performance Standards**: Reproducible classification (AUC ≥0.80, F1 ≥0.70) with SHAP-based interpretability and literature concordance ≥80%.

### Key Research Areas
- Oral-gut microbial axis in cognitive decline and systemic inflammation
- Multimodal data integration for AD biomarker discovery
- Explainable AI with biologically interpretable, literature-grounded insights
- Systems-level modeling of microbiome-immune-brain interactions

## Technical Expertise

- **AI/ML**: Large language models (fine-tuning, RAG), ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM), graph neural networks, explainable AI (SHAP)
- **Computational Biology**: Metagenomic sequencing analysis, multi-omics integration, systems modeling, differential abundance methods
- **Infrastructure**: GPU-accelerated workstations (NVIDIA H200), HPC clusters, containerization, version control, reproducible workflows
- **Tools**: Python, R, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, QIIME2, MetaPhlAn, scikit-learn

## Publications & Impact
