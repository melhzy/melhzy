**Postdoctoral Associate** | UMass Chan Medical School  
**Research Focus**: AI-Driven Alzheimer's Disease Research

## About Me

I develop multimodal AI systems for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, integrating microbiome, immune, metabolomic, and clinical data to advance diagnosis, prediction, and mechanistic understanding. My work bridges computational biology, machine learning, and translational neuroscience.

## Current Projects

**ADAM (Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model)**: A multi-agent AI reasoning system combining large language models with ensemble machine learning to:
- Integrate gut/oral microbiomes, immune profiles, metabolomics, and peripheral biomarkers
- Generate biologically interpretable, literature-grounded insights for AD classification
- Achieve reproducible performance (AUC ≥0.80, F1 ≥0.70) with SHAP-based explainability

**Key Research Areas**:
- Oral-gut microbial axis in cognitive decline
- Multimodal data integration for AD biomarker discovery
- Explainable AI for clinical applications
- Systems-level modeling of microbiome-immune-brain interactions

## Technical Expertise

- **AI/ML**: Large language models, ensemble methods, graph neural networks, interpretable ML
- **Computational Biology**: Metagenomic analysis, multi-omics integration, systems modeling
- **Tools**: Python, R, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, SHAP, HPC workflows

## Publications

Recent work includes ADAM-1 (IEEE Access, 2025), oral-gut microbiome axis studies, and multimodal graph neural networks for AD research. See [My_Publications/](My_Publications/) for details.

## Collaboration

I'm interested in collaborations involving:
- Multimodal AI for biomedical applications
- Microbiome-brain axis research
- Explainable AI in clinical settings
- Deep learning for neurodegenerative diseases
