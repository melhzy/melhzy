## Summary

As a Postdoctoral Associate in the Haran Lab at UMass Chan Medical School, my research applies artificial intelligence and deep learning methodologies to advance the understanding of Alzheimer's disease and other complex heterogeneous conditions. I work with multimodal data, including microbiome profiles, blood-based biomarkers, immune measures, metabolomics, clinical records, and scientific literature, using statistical learning, machine learning, and large language models. I develop frameworks such as the Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model (ADAM) that enable comprehensive integration of these diverse data types and combine computational approaches with biological insights. This research aims to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and develop computational approaches that may inform future therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

- **Developing AI Frameworks for Alzheimer's Research:** Developed ADAM, a multi-agent reasoning framework integrating large language models with ensemble classifiers for Alzheimer's disease classification (published IEEE Access, 2025). Leading development of ADAM-2, expanding to oral/gut microbiomes, peripheral biomarkers, immune measures, metabolomics, and neuroimaging within the ATN framework. Fine-tuning domain-specific language models on Alzheimer's literature using LoRA/QLoRA techniques with retrieval-augmented generation.

- **Building Scalable AI Infrastructure:** Work with GPU-accelerated workstations and enterprise infrastructure for large-scale model training. Develop ensemble machine learning approaches with robust resampling for reproducibility. Maintain open-source bioinformatics frameworks with automated testing and implement reproducible workflows using version control and containerization.

- **Driving Research Impact Through Collaboration:** Contributing to federally-funded projects developing computational platforms for multimodal biomedical data analysis. Collaborating across clinical departments to analyze longitudinal patient data from large cohorts. Published peer-reviewed articles on AI disease classification, microbiome analysis, and computational methodologies. Developing open-source platforms for data harmonization and interpretable AI analysis.
