## Summary

As a Postdoctoral Associate in the Haran Lab at UMass Chan Medical School, I apply artificial intelligence to unlock new insights into Alzheimer's disease and other complex heterogeneous conditions. By integrating statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, and large language models, I analyze multimodal data, such as blood-based biomarkers, immune measures, metabolomics, microbiome profiles, clinical records, and scientific literature, to accelerate biomedical discoveries and advance precision healthcare. My work bridges cutting-edge AI methodologies with real-world clinical impact, translating computational insights into actionable strategies for understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases.

### What I Do

**Developing AI Frameworks for Alzheimer's Research**
- Developed ADAM (Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model), a multimodal AI reasoning system that classifies AD status from gut microbiome data with superior prediction accuracy and interpretable explanations (published 2025)
- Leading development of ADAM-2, a next-generation foundation model and modular reasoning platform that integrates multimodal AD data (neuroimaging, blood biomarkers, immune measures, metabolomics, multi-site microbiome profiles) within the Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN) framework
- Building NeuroMind, a domain-specific large language model, and ADAM Hub interface with reinforcement learning and vector databases to enable interpretable exploration of AD biology and support individualized risk prediction
- Author reviews and commentaries on multimodal graph neural networks and AI in cancer research, establishing theoretical foundations and adapting cutting-edge methodologies to advance neurodegenerative disease research

**Building Scalable AI Infrastructure**
- Deploy and fine-tune domain-specific large language models on NVIDIA DGX systems (including DGX Spark) with full GPU acceleration
- Design customized statistical and deep learning approaches for complex biomedical data challenges
- Maintain MDITRE2 (v1.0.1), an open-source framework for temporal microbiome analysis with production-ready infrastructure, dual-language support (Python/R), and 100% test coverage
- Ensure data security, scalability, and reproducibility across all AI implementations

**Driving Research Impact Through Collaboration**
- Lead NIH R01-funded project to develop a unified computational and reasoning platform that serves as a resource for the AD research community and foundation for improving diagnosis, guiding therapeutic development, and informing clinical management
- Collaborate with the Department of Microbiology from the Department of Emergency Medicine, analyzing longitudinal data from over 300 older adults to develop personalized predictive models of cognitive decline
- Published 7 papers in 2025 across research articles, reviews, and commentaries on urinary microbiome, genetic networks, and AI methodologies
- Developing ADAM Hub as a modular, open-source, community-accessible framework for AD analysis with tools for data harmonization, model pipelines, and secure deployment to make advanced AI available for all Alzheimer's researchers
